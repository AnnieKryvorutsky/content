                <head> LAND VALUES IN EGYPT.</head>
                <p>We call attention to an article on the above subject by Mr. Lang Anderson in the
                    last Journal of the British Chamber of Commerce, and which we reproduce in
                    today's issue. Mr. Anderson is optimistic, but when we follow out his
                    closely-reasoned and lucid summary of the causes why land should have increased
                    in value, his conclusion seems perfectly logical—that prices are not inflated,
                    that the rise has been based on very sound conditions, and that before long land
                    in a this country will be sold on 20 years' purchase of the annual revenue, that
                    is,</p>

                    on the Budget for 1905, says "the country has advanced in prosperity by leaps
                    and bounds, but it is wise to remember that the almost sensational results of
                    the last few years are due, in part at least, to adventitious causes on the
                    permanent continuance of which it would be imprudent to count." Mr. Lang
                    Anderson's article shows no fear for the future, for discarding altogether the
                    high price of cotton during the last two or three years, and taking as a basis
                    of valuation of land cotton at P.T. 250 for the fellah's seed kantar, he shows
                    that land is after all still at a moderate price. The memory of the great
                    Australian land crash, now a matter of a good few years ago, makes people at
                    times shake their heads over the "boom" in Egyptian land, but Mr. Lang Anderson
                    very clearly points out that the economic condition of the fellah proprietor
                    makes any land crisis in Egypt a remote contingency. The article is one well
                    worthy of attention, based as it is on the thorough knowledge of land questions
                    in Egypt. We would remark that whilst land may be reasonable in price, a note of
                    warning has to be sounded against the tendency to force Land Company shares to
                    inflated values. Not everybody can buy land and manage it properly, and
                    therefore there is a strong temptation to invest in land companies, but would-be
                    purchasers should not too much discount the future by paying higher prices for
                    shares than is warranted.</p>

                        "Henderson Brothers.” It will be remembered that Mr. J. K. Henderson
                        returned in November from Europe, and being in indifferent health, remained
                        with his family at Alexandria, instead of proceeding at once to Mansourah.
                        The liver disease from which he suffered unfortunately terminated fatally.
                        His loss will be mourned by a large circle of friends, whom Mr. Henderson
                        had drawn round him during his residence of 35 years in Egypt. We take this
                        opportunity of offering to his widow and family our heartfelt sympathy.</p>

                <p>THE DAIRA, SANIEH.</p>
                <p>BUDGET FOR 1905.</p>
                <p>A meeting of the Superior Council of the Daira Sanieh Administration, under the
                    presidency of Mazloum Pasha, was held this morning at the Ministry of Finance.
                    With the exception of the French Controller, who has not yet returned from
                    leave, all the members were present. The proposed Budget for 1905 was explained
                    in detail by Crookshank Pasha, British Controller, and unanimously approved. The
                    total estimated receipts for the year amount to L.E. 1,288,499 and the
                    expenditure to L.E. 561,779, leaving a magnificent surplus in the hands of the
                    Controllers of L.E. 726,720. The surplus for the present year (1904) will be
                    close on L.E. 345,000, so that the result of the work of the last two years'
                    existence of the administration which will be liquidated in October, (1905),
                    will be a surplus of over one million Egyptian pounds towards the reduction of
                    the Debt, of which the amountatpresentoutstanding is £4,463,580.</p>
                <p>THE KHEDIVE.</p>
                <p>The Khedive, who has been paying a visit to his estates on the Ismailia Canal,
                    returned to Koubbeh yesterday evening.</p>
                <p>This morning, his Highness proceeded to Abdeen Palace and presided at a Council
                    of Ministers.</p>
                <p>COUNCIL OF MINISTERS. At this morning's meeting of the Council of Ministers the
                    promotions and decorations which are to be bestowed on the occasion of the
                    approaching anniversary of the Khedive's accession were discussed.</p>
                <p>KAFR AMMAR COLLISION.</p>
                <p>The great damage inflicted on the dining-car in the recent collision is explained
                    by the fact that the light brake van was flung off its frame by the shock and
                    crashed in upon the dining-car, destroying all the upper works and falling on
                    the solid frame of the last-mentioned car. We hear that the Board of Trade have
                    several times protested against the practice of mixing up light and heavy
                    waggons on the same train, on the ground that the former in the case of a
                    collision become veritable missiles.</p>
                <p>We are glad to hear that the condition of the injured shows a steady
                    improvement.</p>
                <p>IRRIGATION DEPT.</p>
                <p>Mr. R. C. Moser, 1st class surveyor of contracts to the 3rd Circle, has been
                    transferred to the 2nd Circle.</p>
                <p>Mr. S. R. Wallace, 3rd class surveyor of contracts, has been transferred from the
                    2nd to the Zitta Circle.</p>
                <p>THE ALEXANDRIA FIRE.</p>
                <p>It is estimated that from seven to eight millions of cigarettes were destroyed by
                    the recent fire.</p>
                <p>A largely attended open-air auction was held to-day of the perishable goods from
                    Walker and Meimarachi's stores. Good prices were realised.</p>
                <p>ZIZINIA THEATRE.</p>
                <p>La Cabrera was given on Tuesday and yesterday evening, a portion of Don Pasquale
                    being given on the former and Rigoletto on the latter evening. The performance
                    of these two operas met with the same success as on the previous occasions.</p>
                <p>La Cabrera was the opera chosen for the prize of 50,000 frs. by the members of
                    the syndicate, composed of about 30 composers, amongst whom figured an eminent
                    French composer, at the last "Concours Suuzoim" at Milan. Having received the
                    above official approbation it would be superfluous to enlarge on the intrinsic
                    value of the play. No attempt is therefore made in this respect. We will only
                    state that although the interpretation of the title role by Signa Pinto was
                    everything that could be desired, and that she was ably seconded by Signor
                    Pirari, yet the public did not seem to greet the opera with the merited
                    acclamation. This, we dare say, will come when it is heard one or twice more.
                    The pretty intermezzo (which called for much applause) and the passionate nature
                    of the music somewhat remind one of the immortal Cavalleria and the La
                    Navaraisse.</p>
                <p>ABBAS HELMY THEATRE.</p>
                <p>Offenbach's Barba Bleu was given last night at this theatre before a delighted
                    audience, who were unsparing in their applause of what was an all-round
                    excellent performance. The singing was splendid, the music entrancing, the
                    costumes beautiful, and the mise-en-scene good. Signa. Suarez, it goes without
                    saying, again distinguished herself as Giorgetta, Sig. Accouci was good as
                    Bluebeard, Sig. Forconi entertaining as the King, and Sig. Gravina
                    excruciatingly funny as the alchemist. The other artistes all did well in their
                    respective roles</p>
                <p>We hear that the company are rehearsing an Italianised version of The Mikado, the
                    performance of which will be looked forward to with interest by the English
                    colony.</p>

                <p>PUBLIC INSTRUCTION. </p>
                <p>The budget of the Ministry of Public Instruction, which in 1904 was fixed at L.E.
                    120,500, has been raised to L.E. 149,300, an increase of L.E.28,800. Moreover,
                    the National schools and kuttabs have been granted an increase of L.E. 2,000
                    levied on the payment of fees, bringing the real increase up to a sum of L.E.
                    31,300, equivalent to an augmentation of not less than 25%. School fees should
                    of course be brought into account and treated as revenue. It is proposed to
                    effect this reform in future years, but it has been found impossible to do so in
                    time for the present budget. The Legislative Council as well as the General
                    Assembly has repeatedly drawn the attention of the Government to the inadequate
                    provision for education. The pressing necessity of nursing the productive
                    possibilities of the country, while at the same time endeavouring to lighten the
                    burden of taxation, added to the danger under the old regime of unduly
                    increasing the ordinary budgetary charges, has hither-to prevented dealing,
                    except on a strictly limited scale, with the needs of the non-productie
                    departments of the Administration. Now, however, when for the first time the
                    financial situation is such as to appear to warrant a more liberal policy, the
                    Government has lost no time in endeavouring, as far as means allowed, to meet
                    the wishes of the national representatives.</p>
                <p>It is worth while to explain the present increase in some detail. The new grants
                    are distributed as under :-</p>

                    conductorship of Mr. J. Davies-Bryan. The Rev. H. P. Reid officiated and took as
                    his text, "Behold thy King cometh.” Mrs. John Ross, of Gordon House, sent a very
                    large contribution of flowers and evergreens, and these were used to such
                    advantage in decorating the church that the opinion was freely expressed that

                <p>DELTA CHURCH SERVICES.</p>
                <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE EGYPTIAN GAZETTE.</p>
                <p>Dear Sir,--Might I, in sending you some notes of our Sunday services at Mansourah
                    and Tantah, hereby make it known that I am very willing to visit any places in
                    the Delta during the week where the special services of a clergyman may be
                    wanted. For those particularly who cannot well attend service at either of the
                    above places on Sundays, and may be desirous of communicating, I shall be very
                    glad to celebrate if the requisite number can be got together.</p>
                <p>Yours truly,</p>
                <p>T. David C. FIRMINGER,</p>
                <p>S. P. G. Chaplain in the Delta. Mansourah, December 27.</p>
                <p>HONOUR TO WHOM, ETC.</p>
                <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE EGYPTIAN GAZETTE.</p>
                <p>Sir,--May I solicit the indulgence of a small space in your well-circulated paper
                    to state that on Saturday last (Christmas Eve) my wife went to town shopping and
                    on returning home found she had unfortunately lost her purse containing her
                    watch and a certain amount of money. All hopes of ever recovering it had quite
                    left our winds when it struck me to enquire at the Ramleh Railway Company's head
                    office, thinking she may have dropped it at the station or in a train. I was
                    courteously received by the assistant manager, who, to my astonishment, informed
                    me that a purse, such as I described, had been found in a train, and he at once
                    handed it over to me intact.</p>
                <p>Taking into consideration the number of passengers that must have travelled on
                    that day, and the busy time the railway officials must have had, I certainly
                    think it speaks volumes for the vigilance displayed, and moreover, is worthy of
                    all praise for the honesty of the Ramleh Railway Company's personnel.</p>
                <p>I am,</p>
                <p>Yours very gratefully,</p>
                <p>RAMLIAN. </p>
                <p>Ramleh, December 27.</p>
