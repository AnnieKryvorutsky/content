                        interest as dealing with Egypt and the Sudan:- </p>
                    <p>"Let me give you an illustration based on my own experience of the wisdom of
                        allowing free trade to form the basis of an Imperial policy. When some few
                        years ago, the military genius of my friend Lord Kitchener rescued the Sudan
                        from barbarism the question arose as the how, tor the future, the country
                        should be governed. It had been conquered party by Britsih and partly by
                        Egyptian men and money. There were strong objections to simply incorporating
                        the newly-acquired country into Egyptian territory. Had this been done all
                        the cumbersome international institutions which have so greatly hampered
                        progress in Egypt would have come into force in a country singularly
                        unsuited for experiments of this nature. On the other hand, the british
                        Governmemt had neither the right nore the wish to annex the country. A
                        compromise was therefore found. The sudan is now neither Britsih nor
                        Egyptian; it is Anglo-Egyptian. Both the Bristish and Egyptian flags fly
                        over the residence of Sir Reginald Wingate at Khartoon. Foreign Governments
                        had they been so minded, might have taken exception to the creation of a
                        status hydrid political hithertowholly unkown to international jurists. But
                        not a murmur was heard. Why was this? It was because a special clause was
                        inserted in the Convention regulating the future government of the Sudan to
                        the effect that no preference should be given to responsible for this
                        Convention, hall-marked as it was with the free-trade imprimatur. The
                        miniser who sanctioned and warmly aproved this arrangement was one whose
                        sound Imperialism cannot, I conceive, be called in question. It was the late
                        Lord Salisbury. Let me add that, so far as be at present gathered, British
                        trade has not suffered by the absence of any right to preferential treatment
                        in the Sudan. It has held its own well. </p>
                    <p>But I think I can give another and even more striking illustration of the
                        politcial advantahes to be derived from a free-trade policy. Consider for a
                        moment the very anomalous position that until three years ago was occupied
                        by the British Government in Egypt. It was one which rendered us singularly
                        liable to the display of hostility on the part of foreign Powers. We have at
                        times had to encounter that hostility, but it merely took the form of
                        embarrasing our action in local and adminstrative matters. There was never
                        any serious desire enviced by the Powers of Europe collectively to get us
                        out of the country. Eventually our position was regularized by the Anglo-
                        French Agreement, under the auspices of Lord Lansdowne, an arrangement which
                        was not merely of great local importance, but also removed a source of
                        constant European disquietude, That agreement could not come into force
                        until it had been accepted by all the Powerd of Europe. It was readily
                        obtained. Does any one believe that we should have been able to obtain
                        general European acceptance if If so, I venture to assert that inquiries
                        made at Berlin, and perphaps in other capitals of Europe, would him to
                        modify his opinion One of the main reasons why, in spite of the difficulties
                        of the situation, we have been able to do a good piece of work in Egyopt,
                        and why we have enventually been able to get Europe to acquiesce in our
                        continuance of that work, has been that, during the whole course of the
                        ocupation, the principles of free trade have been rigidly applied in that
                        country. Once depart from those principles, and I am convinced, that our
                        occupation of Egypt will be regarded in a very different light from that in
                        which it is not viewed. In fact, this question of comercial policy exercises
                        a predominating influence on almost every question which can be raised in
                        connexion with our external relations. </p>

                        the Atlantic and their possible consequences. The bills payable showed a
                        reduction of £700,000, and deposits and other accounts £550,000. The year
                        had been an exceptionally good one, and they had therefore been able to
                        provide fully for the somewhat exceptional losses on all bad and doubtful
                        debts out of the year's revenue. The gross profits were about £13,000 more
                        than last year, and the net profits were only £3,000 more. The past year had
                        been a memorable one. First and foremost there was a bumperi cotton crop of
                        nearly seven millions of cantars, or a million more than the previous year's
                        crop, and it was all sold at unusually high prices. The rush to secure
                        cotton at the beginning of the season caused quite an unprecedented demand
                        for sovereigns and coming with an American demand for gold, helped to
                        disturb the London money market. £10,274,000 were imported into Egypt during
                        the year, of which sum £4,500,000 were re-exported and £5,700,000 remained
                        in the country, against an average of £3,000,000 in previous prosperous
                        years. But alongside so much material prosperity the speculation which had
                        been going on for two or three years in land and shares gathered force.
                        Urban and suburban land and buildings changed hands at everincreasing prices
                        ; new companies were formed to buy them, and the shares were engineered to a
                        premium and placed for the most part with weak speculators on borrowed
                        money, not, of course, from the banks, but from private people, tempted ty
                        the high rates of contango offered. But the pace became too hot to last; the
                        bubble burst and the inevitable crash came in the spring. Then paper
                        fortunes disappeared as quickly as they had been made. There was also
                        special trouble with Cairo and Manchester firms who had been largely
                        financing their import business by bills drawn in Egypt on their home
                        cerrespondents, who found that owing to the dislocation of credit they were
                        unable to renew them. There fore many otherwise probably quite solvent firms
                        were brought down and the import business practically stopped. It was hoped
                        that this lesson would be conducted in futore orró sounder financial basis.
                        The export houses and merchants in general had stood aloof from all these
                        speculations, and the banks had persistent ly refused to encourage the
                        movement, the loss for the most part falling on the smaller traders and
                        private people. There must still be some wreckage to be cleared away, and no
                        doubt some buyers of properties would be unable to find money to pay for
                        their purchases, while complications would arise amongst the inters mediate
                        buyers and sellers on the instalment system. But all this could not destroy,
                        although it might retard the progress of the country, which had already
                        shown distinct signs of recovery, and a good start had been made for the
                        current year. There was another excellent cotton crop, valued at some
                        £23,000,000, and it was estimated that one half had been already sold. He
                        might observe that the Nile this year had been the worst on record, ard if
                        the cotton crop of 1908 was &amp; success instead of a failure it wonld be
                        entirely due to the foresight of the Egyptian Governinent and the new dams
                        which they had built. Although Egypt had got this good start it had to
                        reckon with the American crisis, which threatened to upset the business as
                        wel: as the money markets of the world. Already its effect was being felt in
                        dear money and restrictions to European credits in Egypt, and naturally
                        there had been a check to the activity in the cotton market.</p>

                    <p>HOME PRESS OPINION.</p>
                    <p>Below we give a few excerpts from the presi comments on Lord Cromer's entry
                        into politica life at home.</p>
                    <p>TUOTTES It is a pity that Lord Cromer, whose entry into the field of home
                        politics we desire to welcome, did not follow the chairman's lead, instead
                        of taking the position of Mr. Balfour and reasonable tariff reformers
                        generally from the statements of their opponents Having begun by treating
                        Mr. Balfour as a protec tionist, and by applying to tariff reformn the
                        nickname of protection affixed to it for obvious, if not very worthy,
                        reasons by the opponents of the Unionist party, Lord Cromer ended naturally
                        enough by declaring that there is no | way to union except by putting
                        protectionmeaning tariff reform-on the shelf. It is difficult to imagine how
                        an eminently practical statesman could fail to perceive that this is
                        impossible. Mr. Balfour cannot put tarifi reform on the shelf even if he
                        desired to do 80, nor can the Unionist party pat it on the shelf. Nothing
                        can be gained by offering impossible | advice, but for those who have been
                        trying to preach toleration to tariff reformers it is rather discouraging to
                        find that they are required by</p>
                    <p>the other side to stop at nothing short of | unconditional surrender.
                        Whatever else it may | do or fail to do, that attitude on the part of
                        Unionist free-traders certainly does not make for comprehension and
                        unity.</p>
                    <p>"MANCHESTER GUARDIAN." Lord Cromer's is the typically English type of
                        administrative mind which deals with facts | as they come along, and slowly
                        builds up a | theory to fit them. Lord Milner's is the op</p>
                    <p>posite type of mind, which begins with a theory | and makes it a Procrustean
                        bed on which facts are laid out and hacked about to fit it. Lord Milner is
                        strong on Protection because it fits in so comfortably with the discredited
                        theory of colonial policy which he alone among Conservatives has had neither
                        the grace nor the tact to abandon. Lord Cromer, we dare say, | would not
                        mind if he could come to the orthodox party view on Protection, but he is
                        saved by his wholesome respeot for the faets | as he knows them, and
                        remains, as he called himself last night, &amp; "convinced and unrepentant
                        Pree-trader.”</p>
                    <p>"TRIBUNE." Lord Cromer speaks on the fiscal, question with twofold weight, as
                        a great financier and as an expert upon this country's foreign relations. He
                        dwelt last night at the Unionist Free Trade Clab banquet on this aspect of
                        Tariff Reform-an immensely important one, though it is apt to be
                        subordinated to the domestio and "Imperial” aspects. There can be no doubt
                        that one of the great evils of this policy is that it would inevitably make
                        jealous ill-will against our world-wide Empire a very real factor in
                        international feeling, and create intense friction at every point. Lord
                        Cromer does not hesitate to say, from inside knowledge, that dnly as a Free
                        Trade nation could we have induced the Powers to recognize our position in
                        Egypt. For that and other reasons he demands that Tariff Reform sball be
                        "definitely laid on the shelt.” It will be interesting to see whether this
                        and the Duke of Devonshire's pathetic protest against Unionist adherence to
                        Tariff Reform will produce any sign from M. Balfour.</p>
                    <p>"Pall Mall GAZETTE." We had rather, on the whole, that Lord Cromer had not
                        fitted on to his great proconsular career the anti-climax of a scramble in
                        those miry fields of party politics where he is fettered by all the
                        drawbacks of the amateur who makes a beginning late in life. But, on the
                        other hand, uniting, as we do, a great respect for Lord Cromer with a firm
                        belief in the necessity for Fiscal Reform, we cannot but rejoice that from
                        the lips of the one there should come so little that need interfere with our
                        attachment to the other. For Lord Cromer's speech is, above all else, a
                        remarkable disclosure of the straits to which a statesman of high calibre is
                        pressed in order to construct an argument in defence of Cobdenism as an |
                        Imperial policy. The new vice-president of the Unionist Free Trade Club felt
                        the need of discrimination amongst the weapons which are kept in the armoury
                        of that organization. He "put on one side the purely economic aspects of the
                        question," and preferred to deal with the influence of Free Trade upon our
                        international relations.</p>
                    <p>"GLOBE." The most interesting, but by no means the most convincing, part of
                        Lord Cromer's speech was that in which he declared thst it was only the
                        existence of absolute Free Trade as the pole star of British policy which
                        rendered possible the occupation of Egypt and the acquiescence of Europe in
                        the recovery of the Sudan and the Anglo-French agreement. We confess that we
                        do not quite follow him. In the first place, Egypt does not belong to
                        England, and never has done, and it would have been out of our power, even
                        had we desired it, to impose a preferential tariff in favour of ourselves.
                        And in the second place, it had always been our impression that the strieken
                        field of Omdurman, the existence in full efficiency of the British Navy, and
                        the peacefal diplomacy King Edward were the main agents which enabled Lord
                        Cromer by successive steps to reconoile Europe to our presence in the land
                        of the Pharaohs. Nor did we think it a very convincing argument that if we
                        adopted Tariff Reform we must be prepared to encounter the permanent
                        hostility of foreign nations, and to face the necessity of increasing our
                        expenditure on the Army and Navy.</p>

                    <p>Trade Club last night is sufficiently impartial in its advice to both parties

                        It is extremely important that the Imperial Jaspect of Free Trade, on which
                        he enlarged 88 out of his long and eminent experience, should al | be
                        brought home to the British people. What</p>
                    <p>is it which has enabled us to maintain our</p>
                    <p>political ascendenoy in so many parts of the y world with so comparatively
                        little friction and co jealousy from our neighbours and rivals 1 It</p>
                    <p>, is, he answers withont hesitation, the rule or ir perfect equality in trade
                        which we have n applied wherever we are able to control policy. g|That has
                        helped us in Egypt, helped us in the > Sudar, helped us in India, in the Far
                        East, e and wherever else there has been a question o 3, of extending our |
                        Tule. We cannot flatter s ourselves that our successes in this respect I
                        have at the outset been welcomed with any o particular foryour in Europe, or
                        that we, i as - a race, have, apart from our policy, any special B gift for

                        unattended with the s friotion and jealousy which are set up when it the

                    <p>A LAND DISPUTE.</p>
                    <p>1 In the early hours of yesterday morning a</p>
                    <p>fierce fight, which resulted in several persons receiving severe injuries,
                        took place between the</p>
                    <p>men of Count Zizinia and those of Abdel Latif f|Effendi Gawish, a French
                        subject, and Youssef</p>
                    <p>Effendi Najin. The fight was the result of a | dispute concerning land
                        adjoining the Nouzha Gardens which was awarded by the court of the Mixed
                        Tribunals to Count Zizinia. Phe qu. estion of possession, however, was still
                        dispat</p>
                    <p>ed by the defendants and on his return Count - | Zizinis found that Gawish
                        was flying &amp;</p>
                    <p>French flag over &amp; kiosk on the ground. On complaining to the Greek
                        Consul he was referred to the French Consul and by the latter to the police
                        authorities. From this | point, however, the Count appears to have</p>
                    <p>taken the law into his own hands and on the | nigbt in question armed about
                        20 of his - men whom he sent to the plot of land with a</p>
                    <p>| Greek flag. It was not long after their arrival | that the fight commenced
                        and not only were nabouts used but also shots exchanged. The mounted police
                        were soon on the scene of the fray and after some troublesucceeded in
                        quelling the disturbances and effected several arrests, among whom was Coont
                        Sininia. The Count, | however, was liberated and a complaint lodged against
                        him at the Greek Consulate. Abdel Latif Effendi Gawish was seriously wounded
                        and five men of the fighting parties also receiv. ed injuries more or less
                        severe, while four policemen were slightly injured.</p>

                <p>Oran, November 27. 2,000 Moors on Monday attacked a French reconnaissance force
                    of 300 men who were operating against the Beni Snassen tribesmen in the Kiss
                    region. The French retreated into Algeria with 8 wounded. It is reported that a
                    number of hitherto loyal tribes have decided to join the Beni Snassen tribe and
                    that different places along the coast have been applied for reinforcements. The

                    Ragshid, near Rabat. The former has been defeated losing two guns. The losses

                <p>THE GREEK BUDGET.</p>
                <p>ATHENS, November 27. In the Chamber of Deputies M. Simoponlo introduced the
                    budget. The revenue for. 1908 is estimated at 130,308,429 drachmae and the
                    expenditure at 126,001,887. It inclodes a credit of 2,500,000 on behalf of
                    Greco-Bulgarian refugees who have settled in the new cities of Thessaly. The war
                    estimates again included 4,500,000 for national defence and 667,000 for increase
                    of the gendarmery. The surplus of 1906 was 4,500,000. The deficit of 1907 of
                    about 1,000,000 will be covered by the previous surplus proving the financial
                    soundness of the country.</p>
                <p>M. Simopoulo emphatically denied that a large deficit was probable or that the

                    arrested for forgery. His two brothers, the President and Director of the
                    Williamsburg Trust, have also been arrested. Mr. Maxwell, ex-President of
                    Botough Bank, recently arrested on the charge of larceny and forgery and who was
                    released on bail until Monday, conmitted suicide yesterday. (Reuter) </p>
                <p> New YORK, November 27. The mining broker, Mr. Louis Straus, committed suicide by
                    swallowing cyanide of potassium as detectives entered his residence to arrest
                    him on charge of forgery. It is estimated that 18 suicides have taken place in
                    the United States traceable to the crisis. (Reuter)</p>
                <p>FRENCH NAVY ESTIMATES.</p>
                <p>Paris, November 27. The Reporter of the Naval estimates laments the state of
                    anarchy existing in the Navy. The sailors, engineers, gunners, and
                    administrators were animated, he said, by the most regrettable mutual hostility.
                    The Navy had already fallen to the third rank and there was danger of lapsing
                    into the fourth. (Reuter)</p>
                <p>FIGHTING AT LAGOS.</p>
                <p>Lagos, November 27. Captain Smith of the Garrison Artillery | whilst escorting
                    the district commissioner was killed and 30 native soldiers was killed or
                    wounded, up country near the Cross River. There are no details of the
                    occurrence. It is supposed that the trouble is connected with compulsory road

                <p>MONEY AND SHARE MARKET</p>
                <p>(FROM OUR FINANCIAL CORRESPONDENT),</p>
                <p>London, November 22. The Money Market. - As a measure calculated to afford
                    temporary relief, the issue by the United States Treasurer of fifty million
                    dollars of Panama Bonds and one hundred million dollars of one-year Trea- 1. |
                    sury certificates of indebtedness was welcomed | by the money market here. The
                    continued withdrawal of gold for America in spite of the higher bank rate had
                    caused no little uneasiness, not merely in consequence of the effect this drain
                    was having upon our own reserve, but also because it was felt that the
                    authorities in the States were relying too much upon this policy to obtain
                    relief, rather than upon efforts to restore the confidence of the public.
                    Therefore, it was hoped that Mr. Cortelyou's action would check to some extent
                    these shipments of precious metal. This is what has actually happened, but the
                    general opinion is that the respite will be of only short duration. The discount
                    rates have already returned to the high level prevailing last week-end. While
                    itis admit. ted that the present situation demands prompt measures, this
                    creation of forcedcurrency is view. ed with little favour by the best people
                    here, and it is realised that it is an expedient which is sure to cause trouble
                    sooner or later. The authorities in America do not seem to be act-F ing very
                    wisely in their efforts to overcome their difficulties. It is as foolish as it
                    is futile to abuse depositors, as both Mr. Roosevelt and Mr. Cortelyou have
                    done, for keeping la a tight hold on their money. The public is well aware that
                    the sole cause of the present crisis is the reckless gambling on the part of the
                    Trusts and many of the banking concerns, la and depositors cannot be blamed for
                    refusing to run any more risks and for keeping their funds locked up, pending
                    some substantial assurance that the Government are determined to make such a
                    crisis impossible in the future | by eliminating the canges of the present
                    trouble. The complete restoration of public confidence along these lines must
                    necessarily take time, but the Government can do much towards attaining this
                    desired end by prompt | ly introducing measures of reform as soon as Congress
                    re-assembles. Meanwhile, we may expect a continuance of the hoarding, and pro |
                    bably, of the importation of gold from Englandand the Continent.  Last week we
                    mentioned that the Bank of France had refused to ship gold direct to | America,
                    and we gave it as our opinion that this was owing to the fact that there is no
                    National Bank in the States. It is now, stated Twith authority that the French
                    Government's reply to the request for direct shipments was that they were quite
                    prepared to put some gold on the American market, on condition that the
                    operation was carried out with the American | Government. It is understood that
                    the latter was not inclined to act as guarantor, so that the French authorities
                    naturally refused to take any risk that might attach to such shipments of
                    metal.</p>
                <p>The fall in our reserve this week is not so | large as was anticipated, the Bank
                    only having</p>
                <p>lost £1,700,000 on balance. The stock of coin and bullion is also only £1,400,000
                    lower, and the note circulation having contracted to the extent of over
                    £200,000, the reduction in the reserve is limited to £1,197,915. The | total
                    reserve is now £19,915,401, as compared with £21,364,247 in the corresponding
                    week last year, and the proportion to liabilities is 38,78 per cent, as against
                    40.52 last week, and 40.32 in 1906.</p>
                <p>Money is in active demand, and overnight advances realised 54 per cent. and
                    upwards. Three months' discount bills are firm at about 68.</p>
                <p>The quotation for bar gold is 77/11% per oz. standard.</p>
                <p>Sllver.</p>
                <p>Buying orders on Chinese account caused a substantial rise in the price of silver
                    in the early part of the week, the quotation for forward delivery being at one
                    time 273. The market has since declined, however, owing to reselling operations
                    on thỏ part of China. Yesterday the price for forward delivery fell to 27
                    tu.d.</p>
                <p>The Stook Markots, </p>
                <p> The announcement of the measures adopted by the United States Treasurer to
                    relieve the money stringenoy imparted a tone of cheerfulness in all departments
                    of the Stock Exchange at the beginning of the week. Prior to this | there was
                    much nervousness, it being anticipat|ed in many quarters that the Bank rate
                    would.</p>
                <p>be further raised to 8 per cent. on Monday. | Afterwards an active business was
                    done, and shares througbout the list showed a substantial recovery. The
                    gilt-edged section smartly responded to the better influence, and other sections
                    were not slow to follow suit.</p>
                <p>The revival had only a short life, however, | and during the greater part of the
                    week the tone has been, as formerly, dall and irregular. The retention of the
                    Bank rate at 7 per cent. was a cheering point yesterday, and the tone was
                    better, although business remained on a very small scale.</p>
                <p>On second thoughts dealers are little disposed to believe that America's
                    financial salvation is to be found in Mr. Cortelyou's latest move, which, it is
                    felt, can have no more than a passing effect. As pointed out above, the
                    restoration of public confidence must eventually be the key which must unlock
                    the hoards of gold, and cause then to return into circulation. The sooner this
                    fact is realised, and the knowledge acted upon, the sooner luay we expect a
                    return to normal conditions. </p>
                <p>Consols.</p>
                <p>Following on the news from New York, Consols were very firm, and advance to 82%
                    for the account. Subsequently they fell away, but yesterday closed with a rise
                    of to 82, ta</p>

                    left off last night at 76, a rise of a point since Saturday. The Fives were
                    quoted 86, at which they showed an advance of on the week.</p>
                <p>To-day Russian bonds have again been active, and the fours have further advanced

                <p>Home Ralls.</p>
                <p>The home railway market has again had a fairly satisfactory week. The shares
                    opened very active on Monday, and renewed investment buying and bear covering
                    caused prices to advance rapidly all-round. North Western went up 144, a rise of
                    37, and South Western gained 2 to 441, North Eastern 1), to 1357. Great Eastern
                    1%, to 714, Lancashire and Yorkshire 11, to 98, and South Eastern "A” 1+ to
                    33.</p>
                <p>There was some profit-taking on the follow ing day, but the market received
                    another | fillip on Wednesday on the publication of the list of traffic showing
                    substantial increases in most cases, and the tone continued firm yesterday.
                    Metropolitan District shares were an exception, these being affected by the
                    circular issued by the Managing Director on the financial position of the
                    Company, in which it is proposed to apply for power to issue £750,000 Prior Lien
                    Debenture Stock. The price fell 12 to 9.</p>
                <p>Home railway shores have today been irregular. Metropolitan District have further
                    declined , and Great Western. 14. Great Eastern and North Eastern are 7

                <p>American railway shares are in a helplegs condition, and there appears to be

                    relief proposals, but this was only a passing spurt. Advances up to four dollars
                    were marked in several cases, Unions being up , but during the remainder of the
