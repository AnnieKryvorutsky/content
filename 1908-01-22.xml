                    <p>If any reliance could be placed upon the jeremiads of a French contemporary
                        of Cairo our Teutonic brethren are a very perfidious people. They are for
                        ever plotting to cause dissension between two of the Great Powers, England
                        and Russia, the latter of which is France's staunch ally. Far worse than
                        that, they are striving to put obstacles in the way of France's "peaceful
                        penetration" into Morocco, which was her "quid pro quo" for renouncing her
                        secular interests in Egypt. Through Germany's duplicity, France' will have
                        to make new sacrifices to maintain the Algeciras compact. In Macedonia,
                        England's policy is menaced by the Sultan of Turkey's bostihty to reforms.
                        He has assumed an obdurate attitude which would never have been ventured
                        upon but for Germany's covert support, In Persia, likewise, be is being used
                        as a screen for German intrigue. All this would of course be very serious if
                        it were true. But is it true? The answer to that question de-. pends upon
                        testimony; and of testimony she has nothing but the "ipse dixit" of a
                        writer, who builds his theories upon bare surmise. His "facts," or what he
                        maker do duty for. such, are no doubt capable of frightening those who are
                        susceptible to alarm and become easily prey to panic. But for 'men of firm
                        mind and understanding" to employ legal phraseology, such warnings, based
                        upon con jeotures which are purely imaginary, present no fear. On the
                        contrary, they ask themselves why they are urged to believe all these
                        dreadful things. Nations, unlike individuals, never practice knavery out of
                        mere delight in taking advantage of &amp; trusting neighbours. That sort of
                        game in politics does not pay. In other words, honesty has been found, in
                        the long run, to be the best policy. Why then should Germany, Machiavellian
                        as our censor may deem her, adopt some other course 1 He can give no reason,
                        nor anyone else. The real truth, though it pains us to give currency to it,
                        is that certain French journalists, not the most reputable, think to obtain
                        a cheap, popularity by goading at a foreign nation, which has proved itself
                        superior to theirs, cot alone in that conflict, which is the crucial test of
                        manliness, namely the field of battle, but in many departments of
                        intellectual activity, whereof their nation formerly held the supremacy. It
                        is not pleasant to take a back seat or to see oneself ousted by a rival. The
                        practical mind, to be sure, accepts the lesson with due humility, studies
                        the situation in all its bearings, and seeks by avoiding former errors to
                        retrieve the past. But all, men are not endowed with sufficient common sense
                        to take their vicissitudes philosophically Some are ever whining and
                        repining at their ill-success, and casting the blame of their own
                        shortcomings upon the shoulders of others, who they accuse of having adopted
                        Unscrupulous methods to compass their discomfiture lu fact, to maligo '.

                        superficial intelligen. does a modicum of consolation. We wish our French

                        proof goods are veritable mare's nests. </p>

                        <p>A Cairo correspondent writes :</p>
                        <p>The importunities of European beggars in the streets of Cairo are daily
                            becoming more noticeable, and it is now almost impossible for aby one,
                            more especially visitors, to walk the length of any of our principal
                            streets with out being pestered by these men, who, unlike their pative
                            companions in misfortune, invariably refuse to take no for an answer,
                            and follow one up until the appearance of a policeman, or a refusal of
                            more than ordinary curtness convince them that a retreat is advisable. A
                            number of these men are cripples, and are therefore unable to work, but
                            it is hardly fair to the public that the streets should be made hideous
                            by the display of their infirmities and by the disgraceful manner in
                            which they are allowed to whine for charity. Have the consulates of gugh
                            people no interest in their welfare and no power to alleviate their
                            sufferings except by allowing them to parade the streetski the manner
                            described ? The native beggar 'is to be met with at every turn, but
                            though he frequently bears the marks of visible suffering in a much more
                            noticeable degree than the European, he is at least unobtrusive in his
                            demand for alms, and it is the exception rather than the rule to be
                            followed by one of these after having once refused to notice them. There
                            are now a pumber of exceptionally persistent European boys about Cairo
                            whom it is almost impossible to "shake of unless in possession of a
                            fluent command of thě Arabic language, these boys some of them are
                            little more than children-have every appearance of being well fed and
                            are certainly well clothed, and it is ] astonishing that they should
                            have-escaped the notice of the police for so long a time as they
                            apparently have done. It is hardly likely that these well nourished
                            youngsters are acting without direction, and it should not be difficult
                            for the police to lay their bands upon those who are responsible for
                            their presence in the streets. Some few of them wake a pretence of
                            earning a livelihood by selling matches or other articles of that
                            description, but this is only the usual shallow mask to the worst
                            description of vagrancy with which the more expert of the professional
                            beggars strive to cloak the real nature of their profession, and it is
                            not fair that these lads should hold possession of the payments when
                            there are so many more deserving people, who by reason of this
                            competition are unable to earn the bare livelihood which wopla be
                            otherwise open to them by this means. The public are undoubtedly to
                            blaine in a great measure that this state of things has continued as
                            "long as it has, if some of the residents of - Cairo would compare notes
                            as to who were the least deserving of these street beggars and hand the
                            more persistent of them over to the nearest policeman, they would be
                            doing the whole city a service by ridding them of what bids fit to
                            become a nuisance such as hitherto has only been met with at the church
                            entrances of the Continent. </p>

                            <p>Strennous efforts are now being made by Mustapha Pasha Kamel to
                                capture some Irish Nationalist M.P.'s to represent his party in the
                                House of Commons. The recent visit to Cairo of Dr. Rutherford, M P.,
                                was a cruel blow to the followers of Kamel, who fully expected that
                                that earnest Radical would allow himself to be patronised by them.
                                But their hopes of: being able to make use of Dr. Rutherford in the
                                House of Commons were cruelly shattered, for that gentleman clearly
                                showed that all his sympathies were with the Constitutional ReEuro
                                League. The Party of Sheikh Aly Youssef won a great victory by

                                Hotel. The chagrin of the Nationalist Party is extreme. If they do
                                succeed in getting one or two Irish Home Rulere to back them in the
                                House of Commons, we shall be treated to Live-interesting spectacle
                                of two Egyptian parties, each bitterly hostile to the other,
                                forming, as it were, a microonsin of Nationalist politics in Egypt,

                                Constitutional Reformers. There still remain, however, a number of
                                stalwarts, who refuse to desert the programme of the late Sheikh M
                                bam-d Abdou and they are determined to carry on their campaign with
                                unremitting energy. Whether this party will ever obtain a bold on
                                Egyptian public opinion is very doubtful The Patty was favoured by
                                Lord Cromer, as is seen by his last Report. It consequently received
                                a great deal of support from the ranks of the higher native
                                officials and at one time seemed to be a power in the land. But as
                                soon as Lord Crmer departed the Party of the People entirely changed
                                its programme. With an utter disregard for political consistency it
                                determined to angle for the support of the populace by attacking
                                LordCromer and the occupation with acrimonious virulence, although
                                up to that time it had been criticised by the Nationaliste for
                                conceiving its orders direct from the British Agency. What precisely
                                was the meaning of this chameleon-like attitude is hard to discover
                                unless it be to make a bid for popularity superior to that of
                                Kainel. It over the Party Wishes to attain to a position of respect
                                in the eyes of any but young Nation slist politicians, this policy
                                of tergiversation will have to be renounced once and for all. </p>
