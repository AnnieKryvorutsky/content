                    <p>"Four newly discovered MSS. of the Bible were reported at the meeting of the
                        Archæological Institute of America." says the New York "Nation," "Prof. H.
                        A. Sanders, of the University of Michigan, reported on four manuscripts of
                        the Bible, now in the possession of Charles L Freer, of Detroit. The
                        manuscripta were bought by Mr Freer early in 1907 in Egypt. They were
                        probably buried or lost at the time of the Moslem conquest in 639 A.D. At
                        any rate the manuscripts all date that period, nor, in the opinion of
                        Professor Sanders, do they contain any inarks of a second hand even, which
                        can be placed later than this date. "Two of the manuscripts are in a large
                        ancial hand, two in small, and there are other variations sufficient to
                        convince Prof. Sander that the individual manuscripts were written at
                        different dates, ranging from the third to the sixth century. He refers to
                        the manuscripts by the Roman numerals I, II, III, and IV. Manuscript I now
                        contains Deuteronomy and Joshua; Genesis to Numbers inclusive, which it once
                        contained, are missing. It is next to the oldest of the four manuscripts,
                        and presents an exceptionally accurate text of this portion of the
                        Septuagint. Manuscript II, contains the Psalms. Although it is the oldest
                        manuscript of the four, and is badly decayed, large portions of every Psalm
                        will prove recoverable. A comparison of a portion of the text shows that it
                        is one of the best manuscripts of the Psalms in existence; in the large
                        portions where the Vaticanus fails, it is perhaps the very best. "Manuscript
                        III. contains the four Gospels entirely. It was probably written in the
                        fifth or sixth century, and contains many interesting variant readings. It
                        is most important, however, because it contains the following extra
                        paragraph : "And they answered, saying that this age of unrighteousness and
                        unbelief is under the power of Satan, who does not permit the things which
                        are made impure by the (ovil) spirits to comprehend the truth of God (and)
                        his power. For this reason, "Reveal thy righteousness now," they said to
                        Christ, and Christ said to them: "The limit of the years of the power of
                        Satan has been fulfilled, but other terrible things are at hand, and I was
                        delivered unto death on behalf of those who sinned in order that they may
                        return to the truth and sin no more, to the end that they may inherit the
                        spiritual, indestructible glory of righteousness (which) is in heaven."
                        "This new paragraph was known to St. Jerome, and the first few lines of it
                        are oited in Latin translation. It has long been held that Mark xvi. 8-20
                        was a state addition to the Gospel, thought to have been borrowed from some
                        other unknown Gospel near the end of the second century. This new manuscript
                        probably presents the original form of that part of the lost Gospel, which,
                        mutilated, was added to Mark. The reason for the omission is quite apparent,
                        as the new verse contains the statement that the destruction of sin in the
                        world is near at hand. This idea is found in the epistles of Peter and Paul,
                        but the four Gospels do not have it, and it is avoided by the later Church
                        writers. "Manuscript IV. is only a badly decayed fragment. It once contained
                        Acts and the Epistles, but not Revelations. It is an older and better
                        manascript than the four Gospels, and its readings will be of value." </p>

                            Cairo which the hand of time and the exigencies of modern life have
                            doomed to destruction. All of us know and appreciate Mr. Lamplough's

                    <head>The Abdin Incident</head>
                    <p>The Sheikh Razi incident continue to arouse the keenest excitement and inte
                        in native circles and contradictory rumours as usual published and repeated
                        as facts i rery direction. If all the versions current the native Press are
                        accurate then we are faced by the fact that Sheikh Razi was and is, at one
                        and the same time, a bigoted reactionary and a pestilent revolutionary, an
                        impious wretch and a virtuous cleric, that he was expelled from Khedivial
                        reception on the ground of a perenal quarrel with a member of the Maieh
                        Sanieb, and that he lett Abdin on his own motion on hearing that H. H. The
                        Khedive declined to receive him, etc. etc. In any case, it is quite certain
                        that a group of Ulema who had made certain complaints concerning the
                        administration of the Al Azhar University, was admitted to the presence of
                        his Highness at the Courban Liram reception and by him severely reprimanded.
                        Their excuse was the usual one - "it was the other boy that did it, Sir, not
                        me," and Sheikh Razi was held responsible. "Al Akhbar" adds that the Sheikh
                        who has been loud in his complaints was recently informed that if he
                        continued to discuss his grievances in public berould be degraded from his
                        office. Meanwhile "Al Zaber" deplores a national calamity and brings out
                        funereal columns with the deepest and blackest borders and the non-Moslem
                        public demands more anxiously - who is Sheikh Razi "What has be done." Can
                        "Al Moayad" or "Al Garida" give us a good account of the incident and its
                        causes t" </p>

                    <p>To the Editor of the "Egyptian Gazette."</p>
                    <p>Sir --Referring to the letter signed "Observer" in your issue of yesterday I
                        beg to state that the statutes of the above named company provision is made
                        for operating "dans des pays limitrophes à l'Egypte'' and the opening of
                        business in Cyprus was voted in due form at a general meeting of
                        shareholders held a few months after the company's formation. As on this
                        point "Observer" seems to have misunderstood the letter signed by myself and
                        colleagues which appeared in your number of the 22nd instant, others of your
                        readers may have likewise done so. You will therefore find room for this
                        rectification in your columna. There may possibly be cases in which the
                        suggestions of "Observer" might prove exceedingly pertinent and useful, but
                        they are not of application to the Anglo-Egyptian Land Allotment Co. The
                        success of the company in Cyprus will depend on the degree to which
                        intelligence and a rigid economy are exercised in the administration there,
                        but the directors were unquestionably entirely within their rights in
                        opening business in the island. Faithfully yours, DUKE BAKER.</p>

                    <p>The Egyptian Bonded Warehouses Company Limited have already begun working the
                        freight service of the Express Nile Steamers Limited. There are fourteen
                        steam barges and some tenders belonging to the Express Nile Company. The

                        no cutting of rates in future between the two companies. Bonded Warehouses

                    <head>The Cholera</head>
                    <p>False Report in "Times"</p>
                    <p>We are astonished to read the following report in the weekly edition of our
                        London contemporary the "Times" : "A bulletin issued at Cairo says that 27
                        cases of cholera have occurred. At Mecca there have been 241 deaths, but
                        none at Jeddah." We can safely assert that no such bulletin was issued, as
                        there has as yet been no case of cholera either in this country or in Sudan.
                        We trust that our contemporary will immediately rectify their error, which
                        may prove deplorably detrimental to Egypt. The report will be eagerly seized
                        upon and enlarged by those who are responsible for booming rival winter
                        resorts, and, emanating from the paper which has the highest standing in the
                        world of journalism, will be relieved by all who read it. We trust that in
                        the interests of the Egyptian I public the "Times" will give prominence to
                        an emphatic contradiction of so damaging and so false a report. The upmost
                        possible precautions are being taken by the authorities to exclude the
                        disease, and, though its advent is possible, it is at the same time probable
                        that we shall escape it altogether. We greatly deplore the fact that the
                        first newspaper of the world should have given publically to this incorrect
                        news, the effect of which no one can at present judge.</p>

                    <head>Zizinia Theatre</head>
                    <p>"Lohengrin"</p>
                    <p>With the production of Wagner's "Lohengrin" the Societa Artistica of
                        Alexandria have placed before their ever appreciative audience perhaps the
                        most successful attempt this season. The opera itself is too well known to
                        require mach comment at this period. It might be of interest however to
                        remark that Lohengrin, Knight of the Holy Grail, is introduced as a symbol
                        of Christianity defeating the Frieslandish heathenism in the wiles and
                        machinations of the sorceress Ortrud. After the splendid performance of
                        Signorina Salomca Crucsenski in "Madame Butterfly" it was a foregone
                        conclusion that her "Elsa" would be, at least, in no degree inferior to any
                        previous interpretation of the character on the Zizina stage. Last night's
                        production clearly proved this. Her performance was throughout, artistic in
                        the extreme A delightful rendering of one of Wagner's tenderest
                        compositions, a rendering overflowing with inexpressible sweetness and
                        played with perfect grace. As "Lohengrin" Signor Italo Cristalli met with
                        very hearty appreciation. He contributed considerably to the entire success
                        of the opera and with Signorina Crusceniski on several occasions moved the
                        large audience to a pitch of unwonted enthusiasm. Signor Oreste Benedetti's
                        "Federico" was a very meritorious performance and in conjunction with
                        Signorina Margherita Julia, who gave an excellent portrayal of the rather
                        thankless, and at the same time extremely difficult, rôle of Ortroda, scored
                        a distinct success. Signor Lodovico Contini appeared hardly sufficiently
                        robust for the trying music of King Enrico, but his rendering was on the
                        whole a good one. A special word of praise is also due to the "Herald,"
                        Signor F. Rosconi. Signor Giovanni Zaocani is to be congratulated on the
                        excellence of his orchestra, and the chorus master is certainly to be
                        complimented upon the high degree of perfection attained in his particular
                        sphere.</p>

                    <p>Surely no more touching and exquisite Mimi than Signora Coniglio could be
                        seen. Not a detail of her acting, not a least inflection of her voice but
                        was perfect, telling, memorable, not merely for Cairo but for any stage. So
                        quiet, so charming, knowing her world of mirth and sorrow, hunger and gaiety
                        80 well, no intent a listener, waiting on her lover's every word, so
                        pathetic in her resignation and sympathy at the last, surely she moved all
                        as she indeed moved some of us. The beauty of the 'addio' song, all its sad
                        knowledge, and hope -"addio sospetti!"-farewell doubt and trouble, farewell
                        sorrow, farewell all, seve pity and love.-she so well knew all love had
                        brought and yet would bring, of happiness or unhappiness, - and the wonder
                        of the death scene, were revealed as they seldom can be. The rest of the
                        performance was never, one must confess it. The conductor was by no means at
                        his best in the second act, and he missed one or two entries of the singers
                        badly. He can do far better than that, and we must hope it will be the last
                        occurrence of its kind. Signor Ventara was not at his best until the very
                        end : there he excelled, and his acting was fully worthy of the situation.
                        His make-up was most trying, and he should really pay more attention there
                        too. The general impression as to the others, was that they could do far
                        better; they were not at their ease, and consequently the spirit and
                        continuity of the performance was not maintained. The 'coat' song was
                        embarrassed and uncertain and hardly deserved the encore it obtained But
                        then one could not but contrast it with Signor Lucenti's masterly and
                        faultless rendering last year. Still these were all minor defects in a
                        memorable performance. Manon Lescaut and LA Tosca are not at present being
                        rehearsed. La Tosca should be especially noteworthy. I hope to see the three
                        chief parts taken by Signor Coniglio, Sigtor Ventura, and Signor Challis
                        That combination would ensure the needs of most operas and above all of La
                        Tosca.</p>

                    <p>Suez 23rd January.</p>
                    <p>The Clayton Company's steam launch No. 2 has arrived at Suez, ready for the
                        disinfection of steamers. The Russian Pilgrim Steamer "Gregory Morch'' which
                        was ashore off Jeddah, and subsequently refloated by the Danish salvage
                        steamer "Denmark", has now entered the K. M. S.S. and Graving Dock Co. dry
                        dock at Suez for repairs. Owing to the heavy rains of late the railway line
                        between Fayed and Nefiche stations has been seriously interrupted, and the
                        repairs will not be completed before Friday. In the meantime, passenger
                        trains leaving Suez for Ismailis can only go up to the undamaged place, and
                        on the other side the Ismailia train awaits to which passengers have to
                        walk. The goods trains have been temporarily stopped both at Ismailis and
                        Snez.</p>

                    <head>Aerated Water for Health</head>
                    <p>The importance of pure water, for drinking purposes cannot be overestimated
                        and overy precaution should be taken, such as redistillation, to insure
                        protection to health. Many physicians advise drinking the ex. clusive use of
                        carbonated or "fizz" waters, because the process of oxygenating water under
                        pressure destroys all animate genus. The robust health of the English and
                        the consumption of more than 4,000,000 gallons of Aerated water in 1907
                        indicate the value of this method of preventing epidemics. "The London
                        Lancet, a high medical authority, in commenting upon this extensive use of
                        effervescing beverages, stated that the effervescent properties of a liquid
                        promote digestion in two ways-first, by the carbonic acid gas acting as a
                        stimulant to the muscular movements of the stomach, and, second, by
                        assisting in the disintegration of its contents. What interests most people,
                        however, is not the scientific reasons for the extensive use of sparkling
                        wine, like champagne, or of pare, effervescent water, like Tansan, but
                        rather their availability and cost. "But we are learning once more in regard
                        to water the lesson that the world has learned as to almost everything else
                        we take into our systems; the count of purity is less than the cost of
                        doctors' bills or than the supreme cost of death. The popular appreciation
                        of this fact is in part reflected in the enactment of the pure food law. It
                        is shown also in the growing use of effervescent water of assured purity and
                        softness. A distinguished French physician says that man is as old as his
                        arteries. Hard water hardens the arteries, soft water keeps them elastic and
                        responsive to the pulse. Hence it is that the Japanese attribute much of
                        their vitality, prowess, and progress to the generous use of their native
                        sparkling water.”</p>
