                            begun in 1300 and finished in 1312, together with other ancient ruins and the
                            Venetian fortifications, the finest in the world. Also the tower or palace, the
                            scene of "Othello'' and of Ford's "Lover's Melancholy.'' The climate of Cyprus
                            in the winter months is delightful and the Island will well repay a visit.</p>

                        <p>One discovery follows fast on another in Egypt. Now, on the very heels of
                                the dis covery of Menander, we have what looks much like the
                                recovery of lost chapter from the Book of Nehemiah, at Assouan, for
                                some extraordinary papyri has been found by excavators in Egypt
                                which showed that the Jews had a temple there as well as in
                                Jerusalem. </p>
                        <p>Previously some Jewish business fragments had been found which showed
                                that the Jews in Egypt in Jeremiah's time worshipped Jehovah under
                                the name of Yahu. But M. Clermont-Ganneau has given "Le Teumps" an
                                account of this new discovery, and the translation made by the
                                German scholar, Dr. Sachan. The document is a copy of a petition
                                sent by the Jews of Elephantine, an island at Assouan to the Persian
                                Governor Bagohi (Bagoas of Josephus), in the seventeenth year of
                                Darius telling how, when Egypt was conquered by Cambyses, their
                                Jewish temple was spared, while the Egyptian temples were destroyed.
                                But during the absence of the Satrap of Egypt the worshippers of the
                                god Khnum had persuaded the local Governor to give orders to have
                                their temple destroyed, and during the three years since they had
                                been in deep mourning. </p>
                        <p>"They had appealed in vain for help to the Jewish high priest Jehohanan,
                                and had written to the acts of Sanballat at Samaris, and now they
                                begged Bagohi to allow them to rebuild their temple, in which case
                                they would be able to burn incense there, and would pray for him and
                                send him a thousand talents of silver. This petition was granted.
                                The special interest of this doeument lies in the fact that it shows
                                that in Egypt, as well as in Jerusalem, the Jews had their temple
                                and performed ritual services. Also Sanballat and Jehohanan are both
                                Bible characters. Sanballat was the enemy of the Jews under
                                Nehemiah, and Jehonahan is mentioned in Ezra x. 6 and Neh. xii. 23;
                                while this seems to be the same Jebohanan who, accord King to
                                Josephus, murdered his brother Joshua. </p>

                                remarkable letter for which we are indebted to professor Driver, in
                                the London "Guardian". Thus we have it a accredited by three of the
                                very best Oriental scholars of Germany, France, and England -
                                Professor Sachau, M. Clermont-Gauneau and Professor Driver. It i s
                                follows: </p>
                            <p>"To our lord Bagohi, Governor of Judah, thy servants, Yedoniah and
                                his companions, the priests, in the fortress Yeb (Blephantine) </p>
                            <p>"From the Tammuz day of the 14th year of King Darias to this day we
                                have put on sack cloth and fasted; our wives are become like widows;
                                we have not anointed ourselves with oil or drunk wine ; neither from
                                that day to this day of the 17th year of King Darius (40 B.C.) have
                                meal offerings frankincense, or burnt-offerings been offered in this
                                Temple. Now, therefore, thy servante, Yedoniah and his companions,
                                and the Jews, all the citzens of Yeb, may thus: If it seem good to
                                our lord, think upon this Temple that it may be built, because we
                                are not permitted to build it, look spon the recipients of thy
                                goodness and of thy mercy who are here in Egypt </p>
                        <p>"May a letter be sent from thee to them concerning the Temple of the God
                                Yahu that it may built in the fortress Yeb, as it was built in
                                former times. And we will offer meal offering and frankincense and
                                burnt offerings upon the altar of the God Yahu in thy name. And we
                                will pray for thee at all times, we and our wives and our children,
                                and all the Jews who are here, if thou doest thus, until the Tenuple
                                is built. And thou shalt have a portion before Yahu, the God of
                                Heaven, from every one who offers to him burnt-offering and
                                sacrifices, in value equivalent to... And no concerning the gold,
                                concerning that we have sent we made known. We huve also sent the

                            <p>What is of very great interest is this almost biblical record in the
                                fact that a splendid temple of Jehovah was in existence in Upper
                                Egypt shortly after the time of Jeremiah; that sacrifices were
                                offered there as at Jerusalem, notwithstanding the prohibition, and
                                that the name of Jehovah was in free use under the pronunciation
                                Yahu </p>
                            <p>There is now no reason why we may not hope to find in Egypt copies of
                                the old Hebrew Seriptures antedating the revision of the text which
                                took place in the first century of our era. That would be a
                                discovery indeed. </p>

                            <p>INTERESTING INTERVIEW.</p>
                            <p>(Gazette's special service.)</p>
                            <p>London, Thursday. </p>
                            <p>The Cairo correspondent of the "Daily Telegraph" has sent a long and
                                interesting account of an interview with the Khedive. His Highness
                                said that he was thoroughly satisfied and gratified with the
                                progress that Egypt was making and that he was convinced that he and
                                his advisers were treading in the right path. The Khedive, however,
                                added that much remained still to be done. His people were dependent
                                on their agricultural labour and as long as the chief produce of the
                                country was cotton and the present prices were maintained, the
                                prosperity of the country most inevitably go on increasing, as the
                                area under cultivation was over widening.</p>
                            <p>The Khedive expressed his delight at the return of Sir Eldon Gorst to
                                Egypt and remarked on the sympathetic and enlightened interest which
                                he took in the country. In referring to education he said that he
                                was proud of the progress the Egyptians were making in this
                                direction. The Khedive remarked that be deeply deplored the tendency
                                of a few young Egyptians to seek self advertisement rather than the
                                improvement of their country by legitimate means. He was delighted,
                                however, that all agitation was dying out and he emphasised the
                                entire absence of fanaticism. Referring to the Sudan his Highness
                                declared that he had every confidence in the Sirdar and his staff
                                and was gratified at the very material progress made during the last
                                few years. In concluding the interview the Khedive declared that he
                                would be delighted if Lord Cromer were to revisit Egypt.</p>

                                Occasions the pigs have solely arrived here from Rhodes and Cyprus.
                                The Bulgarian pigs have been admitted to free pratique here by the
                                Que rantine suthorities. But the Servian pigs, which are of very
                                distinguished appearance, reminding one of our best home, breeds,
                                have been kept in quarantine and will be killed in the course of the
                                next few days at the slaughterhouses at Alexandria. The Cretan piga
                                are fairly good. The total arrivals of pige last week at Alexandris
                                were over six hundred. It is not, however, to be expected that pork
                                will be any the cheaper, for butchers' prices in this country always
                                go up, just as do the rents, despite the crisis Up to date over
                                250,000 abeep bave arrived at Alexandria from various sources since
                                the beginning of the year, which is largely over the imports for any
                                previous year, and yet the price of mutton never goes down, bat on

                            <p>(FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT).</p>
                            <p>Port Sudan, December 26. </p>
                            <p>A smoking concert was held on Christinas Eve in the band room of the
                                new barracks, which was splendidly decorated for the occasion with
                                flags and bunting and made an excellent room for the concert. The
                                chair was taken by Kaimakam W. B Drury Bey. Needless to say the
                                concert was a decided success, and among the many who volunteered to
                                perform was Mr. Buxton, who related a few of his experiences and
                                many witty tales, while Mr. Hamer sang and Mr. Koop played the
                                violin. Mr. Pool's songs were appreciated by all present, and many
                                encores were called for. Although it rained very hard just before
                                the start most of the English population decided to brave the
                                elements and turned up. The concert finished up at 2.30 a.m. with
                                the Khedivial Anthem, and "God save the King," after which three
                                cheers were given for the obairman.</p>
                            <p>On Christmas Day, service was held in the church, which had been
                                splendidly decorated. The Rev. Thom officiated and many people were
                                present. On this day most of the houses and the ships in harbour
                                were decked out with bunting, the S.S. "Prince Abbas" making an
                                especially fine display.</p>
                            <p>FREGOLI </p>
                            <p>Fregoli !- The very name carries with it an air of wonderment and
                                mystery, and ever since Alexandrians awoke one fine morning to find
                                the weird name on every other paving stone, Fregoli has haunted
                                them. It is now hardly necessary to describe who or what Fregoli is,
                                but sufficient to voice the opinion of all who have witnessed his
                                performance at the Alhambra Theatre, as marvellous. His versatility
                                is illimitable, his portrayal of various characters never ending,
                                and the perfection of his lightning changes combined with accurate
                                attention to every detail, even to deflexions of voice, of every
                                character he represents, stamp him as an artist of the first water. </p>
                            <p>With a continual change of programme he does not tire his audiences
                                with repetitions, and although one may have seen a previous
                                performance, a second visit is not only advisable, but almost a
                                necessity to realise his capabilities. One may see him as a
                                conductor impersonating past and present lights of the musical
                                world, and yet have no idea what he can do as a magician à là
                                Maskelyne and Devant, or sit and revel in his Louie Fuller
                                serpentine dance, and then not realise the perfection of his
                                one-man-six-character representation of "Faustino." It is almost
                                impossible to detail even one of his performances, we would rather
                                criticise a whole opera company, than attempt it, but one thing we
                                must individualise; the continual strain, and it must be excessive,
                                of running a one-man entertainment is having its effect upon
                                Fregoli's voice, as at our last visit a distinct and painful
                                hoarseness was noticeable at every breath. We however, trust this is
                                only a temporary indisposition, and that he will continue to delight
                                crowded houses during the remainder of his stay at the Alhambra.</p>

                        <p>(FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT)</p>
                        <p>Port Said, Tuesday. </p>
                        <p>The first batch of 200 blacklegs arrived here last night from Cairo and
                            up country. It was rumoured that these men were due to arrive on Sunday
                            afternoon and that several hundred strikers armed with sticks awaited
                            their arrival, intending to give them a warm welcome. On their arrival
                            yesterday, however, everything was quiet; they were met and escorted, to
                            the harbour by the mounted police from Cairo. Special accommodation has
                            had to be built on the east side of the canal, while some firms have
                            built covers to lighters and have housed them there.</p>
                        <p>Referring to my notes of Sunday, my statement that the Arabs are not
                            underpaid is fully confirmed by the fact that Europeans are offering
                            themselves for the same work and pay.</p>
                        <p>There have been several disturbances in the Arab village more or less
                            serious and last night I understand a store house was broken into and
                            ransacked. It is difficult to obtain official information as no one,
                            European or Native, is allowed in or out of the Arab village without a
                            special permit, while the Port Said police have handed over the
                            patrolling of the village to the Cairo drafts.</p>
                        <p>SOCIETE DES CONCERTS. </p>
                        <p>Last Sunday's programme was perfect, almost too perfect. It was one
                            unbroken succession of all that appealed to emotion, intellect, and
                            mood; first came the Glück, Iphigenia, solemn vivid clear cut and
                            graceful as a Greek statue, then the Handel concerto, archaic, rather,
                            architectural, replete with the symbolism of a Gothic cathedral; who can
                            forget the grave sorrow of those minor notes closing a passage, or the
                            high dignity of the ending, determinate and faultless, the delicacy and
                            strength of the movement, of every note. And then the death of Isolde,
                            the crowning wonder of all that love had know, hoped, regretted,
                            remembered, as the long years crystallised golden moments, lingering
                            until those great mists of passion annihilated all things</p>

                            Tristan and Isolda!</p>
                        <p>- the Peer Gynt, that weird travelled phantasy, from Morocco to the
                            mountains of the North, dawn, the hero's death, the eastern dance, and
                            the revel of the gromes about the spiers of the mountains : - after this
                            the Tchaikowsky march, showing Napoleon in retreat, Rasin triomphant,
                            barbarig, outrageous children at fair, and, through it all, the wind
                            shrieking to the blank snow onder dark stripped trees.</p>
                        <p>The performance was, all through, distinctly adequate. The orchestra is
                            really excellent : soch slight hesitations s e rred were unmistakenly
                            due to the insufficiency of the rehemals, inevitable when we think what
                            a quantity of work the opera orchestra has the whole week through. One
                            had to take exception to the conduoting in parts: that, I think, is
                            chiefly due to temperament: for example, in the Tristan and Inolda, M.
                            Baron hardly realised the full atmosphere, the resonant magie of the
                            music in the Gring, he was inclined to monotony, he could not attain the
                            almost elfish and rhythm of the far North</p>
                        <p>The Marche did well-Tehaikowsky site him, do Glock and Handel One did
                            wish for the old open keyless trumpets, the viol de Gambe, all those
                            instruments for which Glick wrote, and which would have brought out the
                            clear purity of the musie: modern instru ments seem to stifle it. M.

                                that he had been regarded in England as hostile to Great Britain.
                                His reception in England was accordingly most welcome. Hitherto be
                                had known only the Court life in England, but now he had learnt to
                                know the country and the people. He was impressed with the wealth,
                                dignity and life of the country gentlemen, the independence and
                                kindliness of the peasants. England was best describable as the
                                happy country. His Majesty hoped that Germany would soon take more
                                interest in sports, of which perhaps the English were az little too
                                fond. Regarding trade the Emperor William was all in favour of the
                                open door policy although it was impossible at present to introdace
                                it into Germany. (Reuter) </p>

                            <p>167 members of the first Duma have been sentenced to three months
                                imprisonment and the loss of their electoral rights for the issuing
                                of the famous Viborg manifesto, protesting against the dissolution
                                and inciting people to refuse to pay taxes or send recruits. The
                                lightness of the sentence is regarded as a victory for the popular

                            <p>The monetary stringency (which generally makes itselt felt at this
                                period of the year) has hegon to assert itself, and there is an
                                eager demand for accomodation to carry over to the end of the year.
                                During the earlier part of the week the rate for day to day money
                                was as high as 6.5 per cent, and a large sum was secured from the
                                Bank in loans and discounts at 7.5 and 7 per cert respectively.</p>
                            <p>Berlin was a large buyer of the open market, in fact, it is rumoured
                                that the entire amount has gone to Germany, in which case it should
                                arrive there in time to relieve the pressure which was otherwise
                                expected at the end of the year.</p>
                            <p>A further amount of £1,800,000 of Treasury Bills has been tendered
                                for, for which there was keen competition, the applications reaching
                                a total of £3,585,000. </p>

                            <p>Some buying for India has caused a sharp rally in the price of
                                silver, which advanced to 24.5d per ounce for immediate, and 24
                                13/16d. for forward delivery. Towards the close the tone was a
                                little dull, owing to the fact that buying orders sagged off, and
                                that the Eastern markets will of course be closed for the Christmas

                            <p>The firm tone with which the week has commenced has caused some
                                surprise, prices have not advanced to any extent, but there is a
                                steady and growing demand for investment stocks. Consols have been a
                                firm market, but have shed a 1/18 on account of the demand for gold
                                for Germany. </p>

                            <p>The feature of the week has undoubtedly been Home Rails. The
                                ratification of the working agreement between the Great Northern and
                                Grent Central Railways at the shareholders meeting last Friday has
                                had a beneficial effect on the stock of these two concerns, and
                                Great Northern Deferred rose at one time to 49 1/2, but closed at 49
                                1/4. The "A" stock improved to 47 1/2, which represents a gain of a
                                point. The decrease of £6,400 in the traffic return of the Brighton
                                Line caused the "A" Stock to drop to 77 3/4, after it had touched 78
                                3/4. This decrease is a somewhat serious item. At the end of
                                November the aggregate decrease for the half year looked like
                                approaching £50,000; this however has now been exceeded, the
                                shrinkage now being £50,273. Large economies are expected in the
                                working of the company, and it is thought that when the figures come
                                to be finally adjusted, these will effect the decrease in the
                                traffic returns. </p>
                            <p>Americans</p>
                            <p>The feeling in Lombard street is that credits outstanding in America
                                against commercial enterprises are great, and that it will take some
                                time to bring the condition of things to a normal level. This
                                feeling had an adverse effect on American rails, although they
                                opened firm, and (in some of the leading issues) prices rose above
                                parity, suffered a relapse. The offers of stock from New York did
                                not tend to improve the situation, but added still further to the
                                depression.</p>
                            <p>Foreign Bonds.</p>
                            <p>The prospect of a new issue of Peruvian Stock, was not very
                                cheerfully received by the market and a large quantity of selling
                                orders brought the price down. The Debentures dropped 2 ½ to 95 ½,
                                the Preference 2 ¾ to 30 ¼ and the Ordinary ¾, to 7 ¼. International
                                stocks were steady, but Paris selling caused Russian Bonds to
                                relapse slightly. </p>
                            <p>The Mining Markets.</p>
                            <p>The Mining carry over, coming immediately after the Christmas
                                holidays as it does, has been the means of reducing the amount of
                                business in this department, although there has not been the
                                stagnation that many members looked for. Some interest was infused
                                into the Kaffir Circus by Paris buying Rand Mines, and the slight
                                improvement in the leading speculative issues was partly due to
                                dealings in connection with end of the year options which matured on
                                Monday. The following particulars of dividends declared by forty six
                                Rand Companies to date, this year, may be of interest. The total
                                amount aggregates £6,962,500 an increase of £1,396,500 compared with
                                1906, when there were 39 companies declaring dividends. The outside
                                district gold mine yielded £169,162, so that the grand aggregate is
                                £7,131,600. Rand dividends represent 26 percent of the output and 5s
                                3d per sovereignn yielded. </p>

                            <p>Business was not brisk in the Copper Group, but an improvement was
                                noted; this was undoubtedly due to the rise in the price of the
                                metal which later put on £1 to £60 15 0 per ton on account of some
                                "bear" covering. </p>

                                created a rather favourable impression here. The length of the
                                waterway to be crossed is not less that 1,700 ft, and the work is
                                destined to play an important part in the development of the Lower

                                was engineer lieutenant of the cruiser "Boadicea," and was in

                                her moorings in Hongkong harbour, is to be commissioned with a crew
                                of 106 of all ranks for services on the West Coast of America. It is
                                just ten years ago since she passed through the Mediterranean and
                                the Suez Canal to her present station. The "Phoenix," her sister
                                sloop, which accompanied her on that occasion, was completely
                                wrecked and driven ashore in the typhoon at Hongkong on the 16th
                                October, 1906.</p>
                            <p>The command of the 3rd Battalion King's Royal Rifles Corps,
                                Aldershot, and orders for Crete falls vacant a little earlier than

                                staff service. In the ordinary course he would have completed four
                                years in command on the 24th prox. The step should go to Major R.S.

                            <p>As has been already intimated in these note the Army Council have
                                decided to adopt a longer bayonet than the regulation one in use,
                                and to that end a modification of the Japanese bayonet, which did
                                good work in the Far Eastern struggle is to be manufactured for use
                                with the short magazine rifle. The new weapon is much longer that
                                the existing one as long as the old Martini Henry rifle bayonet,
                                triangular in formation, and tapered to a keen point in order to
                                obviate top-heaviness. It will be cased in a leather scabbard, with
                                black steel tip, and the fixing on will be done as in the present
                                bayonet. The long bayonet will give the soldier a better reach in
                                close fighting and in irregular fighting such often occurs on the
                                frontier of the Empire.</p>

                            <p>FIRST WINTER MEETING</p>
                            <p>FIRST DAY. The New Year opened well from the racing point of view:
                                let us hope that everything else will start as satisfactorily. The
                                day was warm and genial, the unpleasant winds of the last few days
                                having kindly left us in peace. There was quite a large gathering of
                                spectators to witness the afternoon's sport. The finishes were not
                                quite so close, with the exception of two races, as those of the
                                last meeting, but we saw better horses this meeting. The first race
                                Suleik only just won by a short head, Jenkins just managing in the
                                last stride to get him home. It looked at one time, as if Roland
                                must win, and was the closest finish we have seen for many a day. In
                                the Delta stakes Aurelius won easily, bat Jap who was second ran
                                well and has a great stride. Carlton's performance was
                                disappointing. Jenkins again was the winning jockey. We heartily
                                congratulate Mr. Eyre on winning the steeple chase on his own horse
                                Hector, who had been previously beaten by most of the other horses
                                in hurdle races and this time was evidently ridden with great
                                judgment. Challoner had a spill Mercury coming down at the water
                                jump, and Bonser's horse pecked badly at the next jump, putting him
                                down. In the Cairo Derby Jenkins role a great race on Mulberry, his
                                third win in the day. --Iron Sand made a great effort to win,
                                Jenkins only just managing to keep in front for the Breeders Stakes.
                                Eua won comfortably, Jean d'Arc second and Firefly pulling up lame
                                third. In the last race Mleyhan won easily, it is a pity he had not
                                something better to run against -- he was handly expected to win. He
                                gallops in excellent style and we wish his sporting owners luck with
                                him. Bonser, the jockey, has unfortunately broken his collar bone,
                                and Thompson was a good deal knocked about when Shendi came down. We
                                regret to say Shendi was so much injured that he had to be shot. We
                                must not forget to congratulate the handicappers, Bakri Bey and Mr.
                                Friend on their excellent handicapping. Also we include Mr.
                                Schreiber in our congratulations on his winning the big race, the
                                Cairo Derby.</p>
                            <p>(FROM OUR LADY CORRESPONDENT), </p>
                            <p>Perfect weather, glorious sunshine and no wind, graced the New Year
                                and attracted most people to Ghezireh, the only drawback to a most
                                successful meeting being the accident to Thompson in the Cairo
                                Derby. The bulk of spectators never realized at the first that
                                anything untoward had happened, for the accident occured far away
                                from the stand, and it was not until anxious towards, police and
                                others began hurrying down the course that one realized that
                                anything was wrong. Eventually the injured man was carried off the
                                ground on a stretcher. Such things always cast gloom over an
                                afternoon, but on this occasion luckily the injuries were said not
                                to be really serious, and the events of the programme were resumed
                                soon afterwards. The attendance was excellent. Lady Gorst was there
                                in a pretty gown of biscuit coloured cloth with a quantity of silk
                                braid lace about the shoulder. Lady Valda Machel was also present
                                and the Count von Bernsdorn and his daughter, the Hon. Mr. and Mrs.
                                Iddings with Miss Iddings in a smart grey tailor frock, her hair no
                                longer down her back. General and Mrs. Bullock attended the meeting;
                                it is ber first appearance since her illness, and it was also the
                                first appearance of Mrs. Dunbar, whom we all remember as Miss
                                Hurley. Her marriage to Capt. Dunbar who was A.D.C. to General
                                Bullock last season, only took place in Paris a week or so ago: and
                                they are spending the next few week with Mrs. Dauhar's sister. Mrs.
                                Schreiber, whose wedding took place just about year ago</p>
                            <p>It is not often that Maitre Carton de Wiart is seen in the enclosure,
                                but on this ocasion he was noticed with his small son and rephew,
                                who are spending their holiday in Cairo. It was the first visit to
                                Ghezireh of Mrs. Irene Hervey who had journeyed up from Helouan with
                                Mr. R. Sharard to see how we managed such things in Egypt. She is a
                                great horsewoman herself and has ridden in almost every country in
                                the world and upon every type of animal. Sir John and Lady Rogers
                                were present, the latter wearing a very pretty frock of blue and
                                white striped muslin with lace sleeves. Mrs. Morgan's velvet coat
                                with ermine collar etc. was charming in conjunction with the trim
                                white skirt. Mrs. Appleton's frock of a pale blue cloth was as
                                becoming as it could be. Princess Irene Duleep Singh were in the
                                stand with Mrs. and Miss de B. Carey and their friends, Mrs. and
                                Miss Shakoor was also noticed not far off. Among others
                                distinguished in the crowd were Mr. and Mrs. Scott Dalgleish, the
                                Misses Coles, Dr. Tribe, Mrs. and Miss Schreiber, Mrs. and Mr.

                            <p>A BUSINESS WOMAN TELLS HOW HER TIME OF SUFFERING WAS ENDED BY DR.
                                WILLIAMS' PINK PILLS.</p>
                            <p>Mrs. Roberts, who has a retaurant at 64, St. Domingo Road, Everton,
                                feels that at middle age she has taken a new lease of life, and
                                tells with enthusiasm how she has been restored to splendid health
                                by Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People.</p>
                            <p>"If you wish me to make an affidavit as to the great benefits I have
                                derived from Dr. Williams' Pink Pills, I will most willingly do so,"
                                she remarked to a reporter recently. "I know that in the ordinary
                                course of nature women have to undergo an anxious experience at my
                                time of life, and it is only in the interest of my sex that I make
                                this statement, so that others can benefit as I have done.'</p>
                            <p>THE MOST MARVELOUS MEDICINE. </p>
                            <p>"My restoration to health," she resumed, "is solely due to what I
                                consider the most marvellous medicine of the age, Dr. Williams' Pink
                                Pills for Pale People.</p>
                            <p>"You see I am fifty three years of age, and, having this business to
                                superintend, I am a very busy woman, so my change of health was a
                                very serious matter. I felt terrible pains all over my body, and
                                sometimes my limbs felt so numbed and stiffened that I feared the
                                approach of paralysis; and every time I moved I had an inclination
                                to fall. My legs became swollen and inflamed, and seemed to be full
                                of water. They became an abnormal size. My feet ached. I was never
                                free from splitting headaches, constantly I had cold persperations,
                                my faoe became deathly white, and my eyes were dark and sunken.</p>
                            <p>SEIZURES OF PAIN. </p>
                            <p>"My appetite entirely failed, and after a few morsels of food I felt
                                a tearing pain in my chest, accompanied by seizures of pain in the
                                back that almost prostrated me. The least exercise produced spasms,
                                and as I went upstairs I would sometimes fall gasping on the
                                staircase.</p>
                            <p>"The nights only meant increased weariness for me. In the morning
                                when I had to go to the market I could hardly drag one leg after the
                                other. My sight became dim, and my hearing failed me. I had a
                                hacking cough. My trials became more severe through an attack of
                                influenza. I lost the power of my voice and could only whisper; and
                                a shooting, heavy pain under the heart gave me great anxiety.</p>
                            <p>A WONDERFUL CURE. </p>
                            <p>"I took many medicines, but derived no benefit from them. Then I was
                                recommended to take Dr. Williams' Pink Pills. Before I took them I
                                was a wasted, almost useless body, but after a few boxes of these
                                wonderful pills I felt quite revived, and today I feel like a new
                                woman. Through taking Dr. Williams' Pink Pills my body was nourished
                                by new, warm blood, my limbs grow strong, my appetite became good,
                                and I could digest my food properly. I became quite strong again.
                                Handreds of customers come into my shop, and I never fail to tell
                                them of the benefits I have derived from Dr. Williams' Pink
                                Pills.</p>
                            <p>AT THE ANXIOUS TIME. </p>

                                forty to fifty. To many it is a time of great danger. During that
                                trying experience the recovery of health and the protection of life
                                depends mainly upon one thing - the supply to the system of plenty
                                of new rich blood. This is obtained by taking Dr. Williams' Pink
