                            Limassol, Cyprus. There is a good carriage road from Kopia (on Railway) to
                            Troodos. At Famagusta may be seen the fine old Latin Cathedral (now a mosque)
                            begun in 1300 and finished in 1312, together with other ancient ruins and the
                            Venetian fortifications, the finest in the world. Also the tower or palace, the
                            scene of "Othello'' and of Ford's "Lover's Melancholy.'' The climate of Cyprus
                            in the winter months is delightful and the Island will well repay a visit.</p>

                        <p>One discovery follows fast on another in Egypt. Now, on the very heels of
                                the dis covery of Menander, we have what looks much like the
                                recovery of lost chapter from the Book of Nehemiah, at Assouan, for
                                some extraordinary papyri has been found by excavators in Egypt
                                which showed that the Jews had a temple there as well as in
                                Jerusalem. </p>
                        <p>Previously some Jewish business fragments had been found which showed
                                that the Jews in Egypt in Jeremiah's time worshipped Jehovah under
                                the name of Yahu. But M. Clermont-Ganneau has given "Le Teumps" an
                                account of this new discovery, and the translation made by the
                                German scholar, Dr. Sachan. The document is a copy of a petition
                                sent by the Jews of Elephantine, an island at Assouan to the Persian
                                Governor Bagohi (Bagoas of Josephus), in the seventeenth year of
                                Darius telling how, when Egypt was conquered by Cambyses, their
                                Jewish temple was spared, while the Egyptian temples were destroyed.
                                But during the absence of the Satrap of Egypt the worshippers of the
                                god Khnum had persuaded the local Governor to give orders to have
                                their temple destroyed, and during the three years since they had
                                been in deep mourning. </p>
                        <p>"They had appealed in vain for help to the Jewish high priest Jehohanan,
                                and had written to the acts of Sanballat at Samaris, and now they
                                begged Bagohi to allow them to rebuild their temple, in which case
                                they would be able to burn incense there, and would pray for him and
                                send him a thousand talents of silver. This petition was granted.
                                The special interest of this doeument lies in the fact that it shows
                                that in Egypt, as well as in Jerusalem, the Jews had their temple
                                and performed ritual services. Also Sanballat and Jehohanan are both
                                Bible characters. Sanballat was the enemy of the Jews under
                                Nehemiah, and Jehonahan is mentioned in Ezra x. 6 and Neh. xii. 23;
                                while this seems to be the same Jebohanan who, accord King to
                                Josephus, murdered his brother Joshua. </p>
                        <p>We are able to give our readers an English translation of part of this
                                remarkable letter for which we are indebted to professor Driver, in
                                the London "Guardian". Thus we have it a accredited by three of the
                                very best Oriental scholars of Germany, France, and England -
                                Professor Sachau, M. Clermont-Gauneau and Professor Driver. It i s
                                follows: </p>
                            <p>"To our lord Bagohi, Governor of Judah, thy servants, Yedoniah and
                                his companions, the priests, in the fortress Yeb (Blephantine) </p>
                            <p>"From the Tammuz day of the 14th year of King Darias to this day we
                                have put on sack cloth and fasted; our wives are become like widows;
                                we have not anointed ourselves with oil or drunk wine ; neither from
                                that day to this day of the 17th year of King Darius (40 B.C.) have
                                meal offerings frankincense, or burnt-offerings been offered in this
                                Temple. Now, therefore, thy servante, Yedoniah and his companions,
                                and the Jews, all the citzens of Yeb, may thus: If it seem good to
                                our lord, think upon this Temple that it may be built, because we
                                are not permitted to build it, look spon the recipients of thy
                                goodness and of thy mercy who are here in Egypt </p>
                        <p>"May a letter be sent from thee to them concerning the Temple of the God
                                Yahu that it may built in the fortress Yeb, as it was built in
                                former times. And we will offer meal offering and frankincense and
                                burnt offerings upon the altar of the God Yahu in thy name. And we
                                will pray for thee at all times, we and our wives and our children,
                                and all the Jews who are here, if thou doest thus, until the Tenuple
                                is built. And thou shalt have a portion before Yahu, the God of
                                Heaven, from every one who offers to him burnt-offering and
                                sacrifices, in value equivalent to... And no concerning the gold,

                                matters in letter in oor name to Delaiah and Shelemiah, the sons of
                                Sarballat, the Governor of Samarin.</p>

                            <p>What is of very great interest is this almost biblical record in the
                                fact that a splendid temple of Jehovah was in existence in Upper
                                Egypt shortly after the time of Jeremiah; that sacrifices were
                                offered there as at Jerusalem, notwithstanding the prohibition, and
                                that the name of Jehovah was in free use under the pronunciation
                                Yahu </p>
                            <p>There is now no reason why we may not hope to find in Egypt copies of
                                the old Hebrew Seriptures antedating the revision of the text which
                                took place in the first century of our era. That would be a
                                discovery indeed. </p>
