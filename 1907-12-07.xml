                    <head>A GOOD START IN LIFE.</head>
                    <p>Mothers should early realize how essential good health is for the success of
                        their child in after life. A badly nourished baby generally means an
                        undersized child, wanting in stamina and vigour. If unable to nurse your
                        baby you must give the substitute that most closely resembles human milk. No
                        farinaceous or starchy food or unmodified cow's milk is permissible to a
                        child under 6 or 7 months of age. The "Allensburys" Milk Foods are so
                        prepared as to remove the difference between cow's milk and human milk, and
                        they are as easy of digestion as the natural food of the child.</p>
                    <p>The "Allenburys" Foods are alike suitable for the delicate and robust, and,
                        when used as directed, form the best means of rearing a child by hand. The
                        No. 1 Milk Food may be given alternately with the mother's milk without fear
                        of upsetting the child or causing digestive disturbance. The dreaded process
                        of weaning is thus made easy and comfortable both to the mother and
                        child.</p>

                    <head>SIR ELDON GORST.</head>
                    <p>Included in a house party assembled in the Eastern Counties some
                        two-and-twenty years ago was a young man who entered with spirit into all
                        the amusements of a very gay week. There was a county ball in the
                        neighbouring town, besides dancing and amusements of all kinds in the
                        country house itself. Of these gaieties the young man in question was the
                        life and soul. Few of those who formed that house party in the mid-eigbties
                        foresaw the eminence to which their fellow-guest would attain, though many
                        were struck with the brilliance of his conversation and the pungency of bis
                        wit. One or two predicted for him a great future.</p>
                    <p>These last were in the right for Eldon Gorst has in these twenty-odd years
                        risen to quite a dazzling height in the service of his country. It was just
                        after the house party in question that he first entered the Foreign Office,
                        at the age of twenty-four. He had, it is true, certain preliminary
                        advantages that stood him in good stead. The son of a distinguished
                        father--for even at that time Sir John Gorst was SolicitorGeneral, and in
                        the following year he became under-Secretary for India--Eldon Gorst had been
                        educated at Eton, and had gone thence to Trinity College, Cambridge, whence
                        he emerged twentieth wrangler. Yet these are advantages shared by many who
                        elect to make diplomacy their profession. It was this young man's own
                        personality that 80 soon made its mark, leading bim on through the various
                        grades of attachd, third Secretary and second Secretary, until he became, in
                        the year 1890, a very important personage as Controller of Direct Taxes to
                        the Egyptian Government. Here was an opening that gave scope for the
                        brain-power that Nature had given Mr. Eldon Gorst in no scant measure. In
                        two years he became Under-Secretary of State for Finance, and two years
                        later came to him the post of Adviser to the Ministry of the Interior. These
                        important offices brought their holder, of course, into close relations with
                        Lord Cromer, whose understudy he became and that so successfully that five
                        years ago &amp; grateful Government improved plain Mr. Bldon Gorst into Sir
                        Eldon Gorst by bestowing on him a Civil K.C.B. It is only during the present
                        year, however, that the clever young diplomat of twenty years ago attained
                        to the bigbest reward that comes of long service in Egypt. Lord Cromer, from
                        motives of health and because of advancing years, last spring elected to
                        retire from his responsible position in Cairo. Who so fit to succeed him as
                        Sir Eldon Gorst, trained for so many years under his watcbtul eye ? So the
                        man of the moment was there at the moment, and now, at the age of torty-six,
                        finds himselt the deus ex machina of all the complicated network of Egyptian
                        affairs.</p>
                    <p>Even bis most ardent admirers will not be disposed to consider Sir Eldon
                        Gorst particularly imposing in his personal appearance. He is quite
                        unusually short, as the men of these days go, with rather a stoop of the
                        shoulders, and short sight necessitates his wearing pince-nez at all times
                        and seasons. Yet bis is an exceedingly clever face, and the eyes, even
                        through their spectacles, have a merry, bright twinkle that shows a keen
                        sense of humonr. In former days no one entered more keenly into the social
                        gaieties of Cairo, and Mr. Gorst, as he then was, in spite of being a man of
                        affairs, managed to be at all the amusing pienio parties, balls, and dinners
                        of the winter season in Egypt. Four years ago, bowever, having waited till
                        he was well over forty, Sir Eldon settled down to matrimony; he wooed and
                        won the daughter of a well-known South African financier, Mr. Charles Rudd,
                        and their wedding in Lancaster Gate was one of the events of the season of
                        1908. Lady Gorst is a very charming and po pular lady, who will do the
                        honours of the British Consulate General with much of the grace that made
                        her predecessor, Lady Cromer, so well liked during these last five seasons
                        at Cairo. To complete the good fortune of Sir Eldon Gorst-to whom, surely,
                        the gods have been extraordinarily kind-there is a young hopeful, who has
                        just accompanied Lady Gorst to Egypt, and will, no doubt, in time carry on
                        the traditions of a specially talented family to the third generation.-(From

                    <p>Two interesting speeches, representing the different points of view in regard
                        to the policy to be pursued in regard to this country, were made last week.
                        The standpoint of the cosmopolitan European financier is tersely expressed
                        in the statement as to the situation in Egypt made by Baron G. de Reuter,
                        who presided over the second ordinary meeting of the Anglo-Belgian Company
                        of Egypt. The official report of his speech was published in our issue of
                        yesterday, but the remarks which we will now quote were not included
                        therein, althongh considerable prominence is given to them in the London
                        newspapers. The Baron, in moving the adoption of the report, said that
                        during the last twenty-four years the progress of Egypt hac been phenomenal
                        from an economical point of view. The position of the fellah had been
                        immensely improved. He wanted to be left alone to cultivate his ground and
                        to be free from the unjust impositions with which he was burdened in the
                        past. The idea that he wanted Parliamentary repre-entation was not serious,
                        and those persons who were really acquainted with the country scoffed at the
                        notion.</p>
                    <p>"Lord Cromer, at the Guildhall, last month, adverting to this question,
                        stated, that he viewed the extremists in this country who had misled the
                        Egyptians as to the true trend of feeling here as the worst enemies of
                        Egyptian progress : the extremists, were mischievous because of their
                        suggestion of changes for which the state of Egypt was not yet ripe."</p>
                    <p>It the edifice, which we have built up here, shonld crumble owing to the
                        policy of the Radical extremists, the Baron pointed out that it was those
                        who had financial interests in this country who would suffer, whether they
                        be foreigners or Egyptians, and he therefore, appealed to the shareholders
                        as business men to do what they could to nip such a danger in the bud. “It
                        was in their power to do it. The extremists in Egypt only existed because
                        they counted upon a certain support in this country and on the Continent;
                        and if that support be denied them they would inevitably and completely
                        cease to exist. All Europeans having a stake in Egypt deplored this fanning
                        of the Aame in England, as they leemed it disastrous to all concerned.”</p>
                    <p>Elsewhere in yesterday's issue we give publicity to an equally characteristic
                        utterance by the very type of person, whose dangerous theo ries are
                        stignatised by Baron de Reuter. The lecture on Egypt by the Radical
                        "doctrinaire," Mr. Robertson, M.P., is the expression of a dia. metrically
                        opposite point of view, which holds financiers as persons of no account in
                        comparison with the realisation of "a priori" theories as to the melioration
                        of Egypt in accordance with Radical panaceas.</p>

                    <p>The French Press in Cairo of every shade of opinion is unanimous in its
                        condemnation of Mustapha Pasha Kamel's conduct to Mr. Kastner, the late
                        editor of the "Etendard Egyptien." Kamel violated all the principles of
                        professional etiquette and also all the ordinary rules of courtesy by
                        announcing in the "Etendard" that Mr. Kastner had been dismissed, for our
                        French contemporaries declare that this is untrue, as Mr. Kastner sent a
                        letter to Kamel, twenty four hours prior to the alleg. ed distnissal,
                        announcing that he intended severing his connection with Mustapha Pasha
                        Kamel and Company</p>
                    <p>Our observations on the question would only be interpreted as emanating from
                        a naturally prejudiced source, so we will confine ourselves to quoting the
                        opinion of some Cairo organs, "untainted by Imperialistic prejudice," and we
                        commend the perusal of these comments to Mr. Wilfrid Blunt and the other
                        supporters of Kamel at home.</p>
                    <p>The Anglophobe "Orient," whose sympathies with Egyptian Nationalism have of
                        late become very pronounced, remarks -</p>
                    <p>"L'attitude de Moustapha Kamel dans l'incident actuel nous oblige à déclarer
                        que si nous sommes des admirateurs de sa politique, nous ne saurions
                        approuver son attitude comme directeur de journal. L'Etendard" n'admet pas
                        que les contrères "pleurnichent” sur le cas de notre ami Kastner. Il
                        revendique pour le journaliste la liberté S'il vent parler de la liberté de
                        traiter ses collaborateurs, aussi cavalièrement, ce n'est plus de la liberté
                        du journaliste qu'il s'agit. Il faut s'entendre."</p>
                    <p>The "Bourse Egyptienne" says :</p>
                    <p>"L'opinion unanime de la presse, comme celle du public, sera du côté de notre
                        ami M Kastner.</p>
                    <p>The "Journal du Caire" remarks: -</p>
                    <p>Il nons sera permis de regretter que le départ de M. Kastner ait été annoncé
                        par l'Eter.dard" en termes peu courtois. C'est la facheuse façon
                        d'illustrer, par des faits, la théorie da rapprochement entre Egyptiens et
                        Européens. En toute chose, il y a une manière; celle de l'"Etendard" n'est
                        certainement pas la bonne."</p>
                    <p>"L'Egypte" devotes a considerable space to criticising the conduct of the
                        Pasha, both as regards the Editor of the "Etendard Egyptien" and also in the
                        case of the Editor of the "Egyptian Standard." We extract the following
                        passage from the leading article in to-day's issue of that newspaper :</p>
                    <p>Ce qu'il y a de particulièrement grave clans les décisions du pacha, c'est
                        qu'elles sont froidement calculées. Elles ont pour but de creuser davantage
                        si possible le fossé profond qni, grâce aux gens de son espèce, rend tout
                        rapprochement impossible entre Egyptiens et étrangers. Mustapha Kamel ne
                        veut pas tenir compte de l'immense sacrifice moral consenti à son soi-disant
                        patriotisme par ceux qui eurent le courage de le servir. Il engage des
                        journalistes pour l'encenser et les congédie pour se distraire. Il appelle
                        cela la liberté. La liberté ? La liberté de l'injastice sans doute ?</p>

                    <head>EGYPTIAN MINING. SUPPRESSION OF THE DEPARTMENT.</head>
                    <p>The supression--for that is what it amounts to-of the Department of Mines had
                        been romoured for a considerable time, so that the actual carrying out of
                        this important thange has excited less surprise than it might otherwise have
                        done. There still, however, remains an element of wonder at this action of
                        the Government, for when it is considered what a large amount of both time
                        and money has been expended in conducting the preliminary work necessary to
                        the ultimate success of the depart ment, it seems to be a matter for regret
                        that it should have been found necessary to suspend operations just at the
                        time when everything had been pat on a sound working basis and the real work
                        of the Department was about to commence.</p>
                    <p>We understand that the Director in his preliminary report to the Government
                        affirmed that it would not be until the year 1908 that any tangible results
                        could be expect ed, as in his opinion it would be impossible to carry out
                        the organization of the Department in a less time. Thus it happens that now
                        at the close of 1907, when the station at Edfou stands in perfect readiness
                        for the carrying through of any necessary experiments, and all is ready for
                        the start, the Government has chosen to abolisb-or at least practically
                        abolish-the Department altogether.</p>
                    <p>It may very possibly be that in the opin. ion of the Government, the country
                        is not yet in a sufficiently advanced position to justify further
                        expenditure on what is, after all, a practically unknown quantity, but
                        surely if this is the case, there must have been a deplor able lack of
                        forethought exercised by those to whom the formation of the Department of
                        Mines was originally due, if the Department was intended only to make the
                        crudest investigations into the mining and geological possibilities of the
                        country, then the expenditure at Edfou was entirely unjustifiable and should
                        have been checked. If however the work, which has been carried on, bas been
                        in accordance with the ideas and intentions of the Government, it is more
                        than ever surprising that this time should have been chosen for their sudden
                        alterations in plan.</p>
                    <p>It would be interesting to know the precise reasons which has prompted the
                        Government to take this drastic action. We believe it to be primarily due to
                        motives of economy, but on the other hand it is an undoubted fact that an
                        oil field of considerable value has already been discovered, marble and
                        sulphur have been found, both of good quality and in presumably workable
                        quantities, and for the de velopment of the pottery industries alone it
                        might have been imagined that a further lease of life would bave been
                        allotted to the Department responsible for these discoveries. While it is
                        true that as far as gold is concerned, the results have been somewhat
                        disappointing, it is in only very few countries where gold can be said to be
                        the staple form of mineral wealth. There is gold in Egypt. There are
                        emeralds and rubies also. But because neither are found in extraordinary
                        quantities is no reason why the existence of other minerals should be
                        ignored in the great portion of the country as yet unexplored, and such
                        discoveries as have already been made augurs hopefully for the future. We
                        believe that there are still one or two men of the former Department to be
                        retained to act in their original positions, and it may be that the working
                        is therefore simply to remain in abeyance. In the meanwhile we trust that
                        the money spent in the formation of the Edfou base, and in the accumulation
                        of the necessary details pertaining to it will not prove to be so much money
                        wasted.</p>

                        home should be aware of the abuse by for eigners in Egypt of the

                        science, and after taking the B.A. degree he proceed to the agricultural
                        department of the university and obtained the diploma in agriculture. During
                        his two years at the School of Agriculture at Gizeh he commenced breeding
                        experiments with Egyp tian cotton, and gave special attention to making a
                        complete collection of the varieties of cotton grown all over the world.
                        Before leaving Egypt be passed the departmental examination in Arabic, and
                        wrote a handbook on "Egyp tian Insect Pests." In India Mr. Fletcher's work
                        included the organisation of a depart ment of practical agriculture, and the
                        establishment of experimental farms for cotton growing in various parts of
                        th Bombay Presidency. Mr. Fletcher continued to give attention to the
                        collection of cottons, and a largely illustrated monograph compiled by him
                        on this subject is now being printed by the Government of Bombay. Among
                        other agricultural questions taken up by Mr. Fletcher may be mentioned the
                        introduction of Egyptian cotton into the Indus valley, and an investigation
                        of the so-called "exhaustion" of soils, on which latter subject he prepared
                        a special paper now being printed by the Agricultural Department of the
                        Government of ludia. Mr. Fletcher has been able to see a considerable
                        improvement in the quality of cotton grown in the Bombay Presidency, and he
                        was not infrequently called upon by other provinces to advise on questions
                        connected with cotton and irrigation for Agricultural purposes. His special
                        knowledge of the vast projects of irrigation in the unreclaimed tracts of
                        the Punjab places him in the front rank of authorities in Egypt on so
                        important a subject as land reclamation.</p>
                    <p>The Ministry of Education and the new Department of Agriculture and Technical
                        Education are to be congratulated upon having segured the services of an
                        agricultural expert and administrator with such wide and important
                        experience, and it may be expected that the School of Agriculture and also
                        the Khedivial Agricultural Society will largely benefit as a result of the
                        appointment of Mr. Fletcher.</p>

                    <p>Yesterday afternoon and this morning the case of Mr. Montana v. the
                        Anglo-Egyptian Bank was heard at the British Consulate before Judge Cator of
                        the Supreme Consular Court. Counsel for the plaintiff was Mr. Halford
                        assisted by Mr. Moss, the counsel for the defence being Mr. A.W. Preston.
                        Mr. Montana claims a sum of £3,000 (approximately) on the grounds of having
                        instructed on July 3, 1907 the Anglo-Egyptian Bank to pay in London by
                        telegram a sum of £11,016 due on July 16,1907, and that his instructions
                        were not carried out. The amount having been deposited at the Anglo-Egyptian
                        Bank, Alexandria, the Bank telegraphed the same to beir London office, but,
                        it is alleged, neglected to insert in their telegram the fact that the snm
                        mentioned was domiciled at the Bank of Egypt; the complainant thus claims
                        damages on the ground of loss of credit During yesterday afternoon the
                        witnesses heard were Mr. Ralli, Mr. E. Moss, Mr. Triandas and Mr. G. Morris.
                        The case was adjourned at ten minutes to one this afternoon until 2 p.m.</p>

                        Cairo, Jerusalem and Damasous. The illustrations in colour by Mr. Water
                        Tyrwhitt give a most vivid and artistic representation of Oriental Cairo and
                        the letter press is as interesting as the pictures are beautiful. It is
                        needless to mention that all the historical details are of extreme accuracy
                        in a work coming from such a polymath as the Landian Professor of Arabic.
                        Professor Margoliouth, who dedicates the book to the Princess Nazli Hanem,
                        in his preface to the work says that its compilation was "s relief from the
