                             <p>THE FUTURE OF THE "TIMES." "Negotiations are in progress whereby it is
                                 contemplated that the "Times" newspaper shall be fornel into a limited
                                 company under the proposed chairmanship of Mr. Wa ter..
                            "The newspaper, as heretofore, will published at Printing House-square 
                            The business management will be reorganised by Mr. C. Arthur Pearson, 
                            the proposed managing director. "The editorial character of the paper will 
                            remain unchanged, and will be conducted, as in the past, on lines independent 
                            of party politics. The contemplated arrangements will in all probability require 
                            the sanction of the Court before they become definitive," .
                            80 ans quite sensational notice in the "Times" on Tuesday, Jan. 7.
                            "How earth's strong pillars sbake! is the exclamation that barsts naturally from 
                            the lip as the astonishing rumour passed from one to another that "Pearson has bought 
                            the "Times!'" wrote Mr. W. T. Stead in the "Chronicle." "The story yesterday was a fable, 
                            but it had some snbstratum of truth But the circulation - the legend gave us all a sickening 
                            shoek. The "Times" has so long been a national institu
                            ion that to hear about it being sold depresses mis as would the report that the Crown jewels 
                            had been pawned or that Windsor Castle had been let for a first class hotel."
                            "The Times." "the bus, bloody and brutal Times' of O'Connell's savage invective, is 
                            still he Times, 'the asylum of the world,' as Kingako finely styled it half a century 
                            ago," pontinues Mr. Stead. "To maintain the "Times"
                            in existence as the authentio and trustworthy chronicler of the Debates in Parliament, of 
                            the proceedings in the Law Courts, and of the progress of the world's history at home and 
                            abroad, is an object for which I for one would willingly vote an annual subsidy from the 
                            National Excequer. No other newspaper even aspires to fill its place. It is unique, solitary 
                            and indispensable. We can imagine England without its House of Lords, or even London without its 
                            Lord Major, but we cannot grasp the thought of England without the "Times." !
                            In 1901 Mr. Walter, who still controls the "Times," made this announcement: "The control of 
                            the "Times" has been in my hands for a good many years past, it is there now. And there it
                            will remain until events over which mortals have no control shall place it in the bands of my
                            successor No outside influence of any kind, of any origin will ever be permitted to affect the 
                            character of the great institution which was founded by my great grandfather 120 years ago, and
                            which has never for a moment passed from the control of his lineal saccessors."
                            The special interest of the proposed changes centres in the way in which they may affect the policy 
                            of the "Times." As Mr. Stead points out, two months ago the "Times" gave a plain bint "to the Tariff 
                            Reformers to bury what Disraeli called the dead and damned' corpse of Protection out of sight," and 
                            this may have "provoked the internal revolution that has led to the establishment of Mr. Pearson as
                            controller of Printing House-square For Mr. Pearson was fir-t chairman of the Tariff Reform League, and it is assumed that whatever may be he political significatice of the late obscure shuffle, it is meant to rivet the bold of the Protretio ists upon the "Times."
                            The advent of Mr. Pearson as managing director will be followed by a thorough reorganisation of the paper, and Mr. Pearson will play an important part in directing the for tones of the reorganised paper." says the
                            Mail' "It is expected that Mr Moberly Bell, who has, as assista t manager, been no intimately associated with the recent activities of the "Times," will shortly retire.
                            "We understand," adds the Mail, that Sir Alexander Henderson, late Liberal Union ist M.P., Wet Stafford, is associated with Mr. C. Arthur Pearson in the great changes which are about to take place in connection with the "Times" new-paper.
                            Mr. Pearson writes to the "Westminster Gazette' to say that he is not acting for any party, whether of Tariff Reformers or other wise, “but it seems to be generally conceded. says that paper, that Mr. Pearson's con nection with the "Times" will make it more than ever a Tariff Reform journal."
                            Mr. Cyril Arthur Pearson, the well-known managing director of the great magazine and weekly publishing business of C. Arthur Pear son, Limited, who has crowned a successful business career by securing the control of the "Times," is forty-one years of age, and was elueated at Winchester, according to the
                            Mail." "Atter an apprenticeship on the staff of Sir George Newnes, he started "Pearson's Weekly," famous for its association with the Weekly, famous for its association with the 'missing word competition. He followed bis remarkable success with this weekly by found ing "Home Notes," "Pearson's Magazine." The Novel Magazine'. "Dressmaking at Home" "Fashions for Children," "Home Cookery" "The Sunday Reader," "The Athletic Reader," "The Big Budget," and numerous other perio dicals
                            "His career as an owner of daily newspapers hegan in 1900 when he started the "Daily Express," and soon afterwards founded the "North Mail” in Newcastle, and the "Gazetto and Express" in Birming' am. In 1903 be became vice-president of the Tariff Reform League and vice-chairman of the Tariff Com. mission, and in November 1904 obtained con.
                            rol of the Standard" and "Evening Standard." In the spring of 1903 he bought the "St. James's Gazette, which he amalgamated with the "Evening Standard." He has pow secured control of the "Times," which has for genere tions been known as the leading journal.' Mr. Chamberlain has described Mr. Pearson as the greatest hustler I bave ever known."
                            "Sir Alexander Henderson, who is associated with Mr. C. A Pearson in this matter, was born in 1850, and created a baronet in 1909. He is distinguished as the chairman of the Great Central Railway, one of the most progressive and energetio of railway companies, which be reorganised, and which, under his control, has advanced from success to snccess, until a few weeks ago it effected a very satistae. tory working agreement with the Great Northern Railway. He also carried through to sucoess the Manchester Ship Canal Sir Alex ander sat as a Unionist for West Stafford from 1898 to 1906. He is a member of the Tariff Commission and a strong Tariff Reformer. In 1903 be served on the Royal Commission on Civil Service Superannuation. He is largely interested in South American railways and in the coal and iron indnstries."
                            The Times" first appeared in 1785 as the "Daily Universal Register." It assumed its present title in 1788. Its founder was an under writer at Lloyd's. For an attack on George III's son he was imprisoned for a year, and stood in the pillory for an hour and fined £50. In 1803 the second John Walter took pontrol; in 1844 the third John Walter, and in 1894 the fourth John Walter, the present controller.
                            The "Times'" greatest editor was Delane, who edited the paper from 1841 to 1877. "Delane went every where and knew everyth ing and everyone," says the "Mail". "He secured such prestige for his journal that it was constantly used as a channel of communication with the public by the British and foreiga Governments. In 1877 he retired, and was succeeded by Professor Chenery, to whom, again, succeeded in 1884 the present editor, Mr. George Buokle, then only in his thirtieth year"

                      Canal which runs through that town. A "Sadd" has been put in near the railway line to 
                      Mansourah, as a bridge is being built, and this has cut off the running water. All through 
                      the town the water is stagnant, quite black, and of a most unhealthy and objectionable 
                      odour, and yet none of those who receive comparatively high salaries to attend to such 
                      matters are ap. parently aware the facts-it they are, they are guilty of gross and 
                      unpardonable breach of duty. To add to the natural stagnancy of the water the natives make

                            BANQUET AT SAVOY
                        </p>
                        <p>Dr. Rutherford M.P. was the principal guest at a banquet given by the Constitutional Reform League in his honour at the Savoy Hotel on Saturday night, when there were about eighty members and guests of the league present The arrangements had been made on a truly magnificent scale ; an excellent dinner was served ; the table centres were &amp; mass of tastefully arranged flowers, and a hand stationed in an adjoining room played a capital soleo tion of music during dinner.
                            Shiekh Aly Youssef was received with lood cheers, when, rising at the conclusion of dinner, he proposed the health of his Highness the Khedive, the toast being celebrated with musical bonours and amid the acclamations of the assemblage. The toasts of Sheikh Aly Youssef and of Dr. Rutherford having been duly honoured in turn, Shiekh Aly Youssef thanked Dr. Ratherford on behalf of the league for his presence among them, and for the sympathy which he had expressed for their cause at the meeting of the previous day, and said that the active sympathy of both Dr. Rutherford and Mr. Robertson had been amply proved by their speeches in the English House of Commons. They could count upon these two men, he said, as being in favour of reform, and these reforms were most urgently needed. There was the question of educational reform, the questions of a university, public libraries, and numberless others no less pressing, and also the all important question of representative Government.
                            The Government had, be continued, promis. ed to prepare the way to self-Government but! in spite of all promises it bad continued in a policy which was little less than despotic, and which made Egypt a dependency of Great Britain Speaking of Lord Cromer, Shiekh Aly Youssef declared that the policy which he had followed of working the country with English beads and Egyptian bands had really resulted in the breaking of the hafids which served him He urged the enlarging of provincial powers. and said that a beginning should be made with the Legislative Council, which, with the General Assembly, was of immense importance to the country
                            The leaders remarks were punctuated with repeated bursts of cheering which was sustained for some moments upon his resuming his seat
                            Dr. Ratherford in replying expressed his headful hawla andatitude for the hanan
                            Dearuru auk anu grautuuu tur u Duur done himn in entertaining him at such a splendid banquet and for the far too flattering and generous terms in which they had spoken of his efforts in Parliament on behalf of Egypt, He could assure them that he was constrained by a high sense of duty to visit their country and that his great desire was to study their problems, so that he might be able to render good service both to Egypt and to England and thus bring about the happiest relations between the two countries. His reception by H. H. the Khedive, by Ministers, Advisers, officials, and non officials, by men of all parties and by those who attach themselves to my party bad been of the pleasantest and most cordial character, and be should always remember with delight and joy their exceeding kindness. He was struck with the beauty and the beneficence of the Nile with the fertility of their soil, with the glory of their climate, giving health and happiness to millions with the relies of their ancient civiliza. tion, and most of all with the sober, industrious, and happy disposition of their people. The sun seemed to have entered into the inner most recesses of their hearts, bringing ajoy and a peace that no man could rob the end of, and that the world would not take away. Of course he had seen a good deal to distress hip as well. The presence of Europeans was not an unmixed blessing to Egypt. The attendant evils and vices were a menace to their simple
                            life, to their moral welfare and to their evolu- tion in the path of progress. He hoped that
                            in imbibing what was best in European civilization, they would avoid what was base and degrading. Great and important reforms were urgently needed in education, sanitation, land tenure, liceusing, lunaey, the admini-tration of justice and in local, municipal provincial, and national government. The discussion of these reforms the speaker reserved to the House of Commons.
                            It was an infinite pleasure to him to find the new spirit of civic and national patriotism steadily rising in their midst. Without this spirit all their financial progress was as sand in the desert, barren and without beauty. Man does not live by bread alone, and the people who are content with rational prosperity alone are of all people the most miserable and the moat to be pitied on the face of the earth. History was strewn with the wrecks of empires and nations, which had no bigger ideal
                            With regard to their patriotic aims therefore he was in hearty sympathy. He trusted all political parties alike would pursue constitutional and reasoned methods in advancing their just cause. Angry and revolutionary tactics bad a kvack of recoiling upon those who indulged in them, and what was still more un fortunate in retarding the wheels of progress. By subduing racial religious jealousy, by reforming social customs restrictive of liberty and justice, by affording equal opportunity to all, by personal and national sacrifice alone would they emancipate their country. England's mission in Egypt, as far as he could see, was twofold. First to enable Egyptians (and by Egyptians he meant all who adopted Egyptian nationality) to steer their own ship, and secondly, when they were managing their own country

                    <p>to protect them from all invaders. No more glorious service would be given by a strong nation to a weak nation rightly struggling to be free. To this noble end he hoped his country. men both in Egypt and in England would bend their energies, and to this end he and those associated with him would devote their lifelong efforts.
                        Dr. Rutherford's speech, which was trans lated sentence by sentence, met with repeated applause, and apparently fully satisfied the expectations of the audience. Several other speeches followed in the same strain, and M Khalil Zeine, Editor of "Al-Massawar" in replying to the toast "our guests" affirmed that the Egyptians could be assured of the support of the Syrians in this movement. The following telegram was received by Dr. Ruther ford during the evening -
                        "Salutes from Egypt Egyptians, you defend their interests."

                        interesting remarks regarding their interests in Egypt and the Sudan.
                        Commencing with the Sudan the steamer business worked by the Sudan Development and 
                        Exploration Company has he said, made good progress during the year; the receipts from 
                        freights and passages for the year ending October 31st, 1907, having amounted to L E 23,148, as 
                        against LE 17,470 for the preceding year. In the New Egyptian Company we have, 
                        thanks to the excellent management of Mr. Beresford, who superintends the reclamation 
                        works which that company is conducting on the Nile, good reason to be satisfied with this 
                        department of the business. We have, in these reclaimed lands alone, an asset of a value 
                        equivalent to the bulk of the New Egyptian Company's capital. The company, during the 
                        early part of the year, realised several of its proper ties and paid us a dividend of 
                        10 per cent, but later the depression existing all over the world spread to Egypt, 
                        where there has been a great deal of over speculation, and the result has been that 
                        shares of all kinds have been thrown on the market, and those of the New Egyptian Company 
                        have also reached a market price far below their intrinsic value. We do not doubt that we 
                        have in this company not only a good asset but also a business in which we shall probably 
                        share from time to time when things improve again.

                    <p>The Earl of Cromer in his speech at the dinner of the Glasgow 
                        Unionist Free Trade Club, on Friday week, replied to the criticisms
                        which had been passed on his speech in London, more especially with 
                        regard to the Egyptian Customs duties, a summary of his remarks
                        appearing in our cable on the 11th. We are now able to give his 
                        statement in full on this point.
                        There is be said "one other criticism to which I should wish to 
                        allude briefly. It has been stated that, although I may be a free
                        trader in England, I approved of a protectionist policy in Egypt. 
                       This is a purely personal argument. Had I been ever so protectionist in 
                       Egypt I do not see that the fact would help the tariff reformers much, 
                       although it might show that I was guilty of inconsistency. But, in fact, although 
                       I do not say that the present Egyptian practices as regards both Customs and Excise 
                       duties are everything I could wish, the fiscal policy adopted of recent years in Egypt, 
                       80 far from bearing the smallest resemblance to protection, based on 
                       all essential points been based on free-trade principles. I will state 
                       the facts briefly. At the commencement of the British occupation an 8
                       per cent. "ad valorem" Customs duty was imposed on all goods coming
                       into the country. Also, in all the towns, and even in many of the principal
                       villages an octroi duty of 9 per cent. was levied on local produce. 
                       The latter pressed far more hard on the population, and especially on 
                       the poorer classes, than the Customs duty. It has been completely abolished. 
                       Moreover, the 8 per cent Customs duty has been reduced to 4 per cent on coal, 
                       timber, livestock, petroleum, and on some other articles. I wish, moreover, to 
                       observe that whether the Customs duty in Egypt is levied at 8 or 4 per cent., or 
                       at any other figure, it does not in any way offend against free trade principles.
                       It is imposed for strictly revenue purposes; and I am not aware that any free-trader 
                       objects to the imposition of Customs duties for such purpose, although he may regret
                       the necessity for doing 80. What free traders object to is the imposition of Customs
                       duties for protective purposes. (Hear, hear.) Now, the only important case which has
                       occurred in Egypt where this special issue was raised was in connexion with the duty
                       on cotton goods. Until a few years ago, there were no cotton factories in Egypt.
                       When they were established, an excise duty, equivalent to the Customs duty, was 
                       put on the indigenous manufactures Otherwise, local industry would have been protected. 
                       This Excise duty, which is similar to that which used to be levied on certain articles
                       in the United Kingdom but a few years ago, and which is now levied in India, was not 
                       imposed in order to please Manchester, as is sometimes alleged, but in order to prevent 
                       an artificial industry from springing up, and in order to safeguard the Customs revenue
                       of Egypt.

                 <head>"TIMES</head>
                    <p>We cannot help regretting that Lord Cromer in his speech delivered to the Glasgow and West 
                        Scotland Unionist Free Trade Club yesterday showed no more disposition to 
                        promote conciliation between the two wings of the Unionist party than he 
                        showed in his address to those present at the Unionist Free Trade dinner 
                        on November 21. Generally, his speech last night was crambe repetita, as
                        regards the fiscal reform controversy, and we do not think it needful to 
                        repeat what we said on the occasion of bis last exposition of his faith. 
                        We prefer to dwell more on the subjects as to which agreement with Lord 
                        Cromer is easy than on those as to which it is difficult or even impossible.</p>
                    <p>"STANDARD." </p>
                    <p> Lord Cromer admits that the national revenue is inadequate for the national purposes, that direct taxation has reached its limit, and that Free Traders do not object to the imposition of Customs duties for revenue purposes. He thinks that by the exercise of strict economy something may be saved on the present expenditure, but he does not pretend that economy alone will be sufficient to enable us to pay our way, and he offers no other suggestion as to how we shall raise the money for reforms which he does not deny are urgent..</p>
                    <p>"TRIBUNE.</p> 
                    <p>" His whole speech was that of a complete Free Trader He repeated the weighty warning given at the Unionist Free Trade Club dinner in November, thật Free Trade is the only sound basis of onr peaceful Imperial policy. He showed that his policy in Egypt was always strictly loyal to Free Trade, so that, when cotton factories were established in that country, an Excise duty was put on in order that they might not be artificially fostered by the Customs duty on foreign cotton. He took all the main points of Free Trade doctrine as accepted without question by himself and his audience; he riddled, with all the certainty of an expert financier, Mr. Balfour's unsound doctrine of the merits of taxing "a large variety of articles": and be declared that Free Trade had partiou. larly benefited the poorest classes-from which it follows that they would suffer most from Tariff Reform.

                    <head>WEDDING IN CAIRO</head>
                    <p>MOSSERI SUARES</p>
                    <p>One of the biggest weddings of the last few seasons took place yesterday afternoon at the Jewish Synagogue when the marriage of Mr. Elie Mosseri, son of the late Nessim Mosseri Bey, to Mlle Laure Suares daughter of Mme and the late Felix Saares, was witnessed by an enormous crowd of their friends and relations. The synagogue bad been magnificeutly decorated for the occasion, the crimson and gold chairs facing the congregation where sat the bridegroom, being surmounted by a high canopy of crimson and gold, The wedding was fixed for half past three ; but long before that hour the guests began to arrive, the crowd being so great that the police bad to suspend all ordinary traffic in the adjoining streets Rarely have we seen even in Cairo such a collection of magnificent toilettes and wealth of jewels as were noticed on this occasion or more bandsome women to do them justice. It was 8.45, when the church was full to overflowing, that the bride arrived and was led through the crowd to her chair where she was met by the bridegroom. Various of the near relatives were gathered round then, Mme Felix Suares, Mme Mosseri, and the three beautiful sisters of the bride Baroness Menasce, Mme Rollo, and Mme Suares. The bride indeed looked lovely in a satin gown of empire cut, draped tightly across the front of the waist and hanging from the back in broad watteau pleat. There was lovely lace draped across the shoulders of the soft corsage which was cut en caur at the base of the neck. She wore a wreath of orange blossoms on her hair over which was the regulation tulle veil, and she also carried a small bouquet of bridal flowers. Her three sisters all wore bats of black velvet surmounted with handsome white plumes Baropne Menace and Mme Rollo had on lovely white dresses mossed with lace, that of Mme Suares was in grey heavily embroidered with a long peplum tunic of grey chiffon. The service was quite short and fully choral, the choir being accompanied by the organ and harp. The ceremonies over, the wine being drunk from the same cup while the veil was held over the heads of both bride and bridegroom and the ring placed in position, the organ thundered forth the wedding March, and after receiving the salutations from their near relatives, the happy pair made their way through the crowd and back to the palatial residence of Mme Felix Suares in Kasr Doubare. Practically everyone who attended the service was present at the subsequent reception, the rooms being so crowded that it was difficultat times to obtain ingress or egress The drive from gate to doorway was covered with rugs, baskets of gorgeous flowers flanking it on either side. Flowers decked the interior, an enormous corbeille from H A. the Khediva gracing the entrance hall and many others living the rooms and passages upstairs where the presents were exhibited. In one salon Mr. and Mme Elie Mosseri stood to receive the congratulations of their friends : in another the most substantial buffet attracted a deal-of attention while waiters were doing their best to cope with the situation and Mile Alice so long connected with the family, was busy dispensing sweet eats and bonbons to the assembled company. A continual stream of people were passing up and down the staircase to and from the roots where the beautiful presents were on view. It is impossible here to give any complete list of the beautiful things that were laid out with great taste on the tables. There were some lovely things in chink, and bronze, electrio lamps and objets d'art of allt sorts and descriptions: big bowle of lovely design containing gold fish-gilt coffee sets and all manner of beautiful things in silver -- two complete sets of toilette necessaries at least, and some very fine pieces of furniture. Three beautiful fans adorned one table ; in a glass fronted armoire there was jewellery enough to satisfy the heart of the most exigeante ; bracelets, necklaces and rings of all descriptions and values, including one enormous emerald mounted as a brooch, a superb string of pearls, and a long chain stand. ded at close intervals with fine diamonds.
                        As it is impossible to enumerate the presents so also it is impossible to mention a title of the people who responded to the invitations with their presence. Amongst them we notice Lady Valda Machell and Mr. Machell, Dr. Martino Pasha and Mme de Martino, Count Zogheb, Mme. Balai in a beautiful gown of soft apricot satin with delicate gold embroideries and touches of pale blue about the corsage. Mme. Rachael Cattaui, one of the handsomest women present, was wearing a beautiful princess frock of white cloth, heavily soutache, the wide rivers across the shoulders meeting at the waist over the collarless vest of fine lace. She also wore a black bat with white plumes, and beautiful pearls about her neck. Her sister Mlle Frances was in white. Mrs. Schuyler Rose was very handsomely gowned in a transparent black lace dress relieved with velvet worn over white. Miss Ross was in a
                        delightful cloth toilette, Dearly white, both long semi-fitting coat and skirt heavily soutaob. ed; her most becoming bat was of pale pink satin, the wido brim lined with heliotrope, and the crown almost hidden by a mass of pink feathers. Mme Osorio who was present with her husband, the Spanish Minister, was in white with a pretty bat bear ing shaded brown roses. Mme Generapoulo was in white with a bat of violet Mme Levy was in a lovely froek of dull purple. Mme Rath was in a dress of fine Irish lace bearing straps of oriental embroidery. We noticed Mr. and Mrs. Swott Dalgliesh, Mme Heller, Mme Aghion,
                        Maltre and Mrs. Carton de Wiart with their - son and nephew, Senateur and Mme Adamoli
                        and their daughters both in white, Mme and MIT de Villebois, Mr.Saint Saëns, Mr.Grainger Stew. art, Mr. Giulio Torlonia, Mr. F. Berra Nathan, the Misses James, Harari Pasbs and his two daughters, Nabar Pasha, Mme Mansont in green, the Countess della Sala, Countess Doncini, Countess Bracoeschi, Countess Siciliani and many other of the notabilities of Cairo and Alexandria. In her capacity as hostess Mme Felix Suares was very ably supported by her daughters and her son, Messieurs Leon and André Suares, who were indefatigable in the performance of their duties. The reception was in every way most successful one and the bride and bridegroom carried away with them the hearties congratulations of every guest who was present,

                    <p>Sir-I note "a Sufferer's" complaint of yesterday and may say I went repeatedly to the P.O. to get letters, and often found thirty or more people at my section, D-L, and the frowsy mob of all sorts and conditions fairly frightened me away. Of course it must be a difficult problem with the mixed Cairo population, but it is rather &amp; sad sight to see hundreds of people, many utterly poverty stricken and wretched, waiting their turn for letters, many containing remittances probably. I think since I was here first in 1909 the Cairo PO. has to cope with a vastly increased business and has outgrown its capacity. The P.O. building is utterly unworthy of such city as Cairo. The letters might be divided into a few more sections or ench section could have an extra clerk and pigeon bole. I must, however, pay a tribute to the courtesy shown me by Mr. Williams, the Director at Cairo, and bis chief, Borton Bey in Cairo over some letters that were missing through no fault of the P.0 I regard the administration of the Egyptian Post Office as marvellously well run, considering the exceptional difficulties of the diverse languages and the continual arrival of mails by every steamer and the im possibility of obtaining the national stat that France, England, and Italy can obtain:
