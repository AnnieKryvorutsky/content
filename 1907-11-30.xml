                    <p>WHAT THE AMERICAN PANIC</p>
                    <p>MEANS. "It is well that our people should realise the character of the
                        tremendous disaster which has prostrated and paralysed the credit of the
                        United States at a time when the crops are good and trade is booming,' says
                        the "Star. "We have never experienced anything like it. For weeks the great
                        banks have refused to cash cheques, and employers have not been able to get
                        cash to pay their workmen.</p>
                    <p>"The New York correspondent of the "Daily Telegraph" says :</p>
                    <p>"'It is evident from the European newspapers arriving lately, and the
                        cablegrams published here to-day, that you in England, while appreciating
                        the extent and importance of the crisis from the financial point of view,
                        have rather failed to understand how deeply this crisis is eating into the
                        hearts and homes of people of all classes, and how seriously it affects the
                        relations of everyday life. Now and then some lorid sidelight is thrown upon
                        the tragedy of the situation, as on Friday, when Mr. Barney, late president
                        of the Knickerbooker Trust, shot himself, and again yesterday, when
                        Professor Underwood, of Columbia University, crazed by his money losses,
                        went mad, murdered his wife, and. then cut his own throat.'</p>
                    <p>"He goes on to say that the American newspapers, desiring to calm the public
                        mind, are either suppressing or failing to emphasise the truth. Our own
                        information confirms this, for there is no doubt that the situation has been
                        and is so serious that the Press has been unanimously engaged in a concerted
                        effort to conceal the facts. The building trades are paralysed for lack of
                        money, and tens of thousands of men are out of work. Miners, labourers, and
                        mill hands are taking friglit and flying home. Hoboken is thronged with
                        returning emigrants. Before the winter ends it is estimated that half a
                        million alien emigrants will have left the United States. In the graphic
                        phrase of Mr. Birdeoler, 'Ruin's ghastly face stares at all.'"</p>
                    <p>"Some months ago, when congratulated by a friend on his phenomenal
                        popularity, President Roosevelt-according to newspaper report ---predicted
                        that should a period of hard times' visit the country before his term of
                        office expired, he would become the most unpopular of Presidents. Europe,
                        according to a number of cable dispatches," says the "Literary Digest", "is
                        inclined to think that this unpopularity has already overtaken him as a
                        result of the severe financial shake-up from which the country is only now
                        regaining its equilibrium.</p>
                    <p>"Thus the Paris ``Matin", once his ardent champion, now regards him as a
                        fallen idol, and asserts that this panie 'will be recorded in history as the
                        Roosevelt panic. He has proved his destructive capacity, says the same
                        paper, by killing bears and wiping out billions of dollars in values. In the
                        United States, however very few papers which were not already conspicuously
                        anti-Roosevelt in their attitude attempt to saddle him with responsibility
                        for the piano, although some independent sheets ask whether possibly the
                        famous Roosevelt lack may riot be breaking at last. </p>

                        <p>CONSTANTINOPLE, November 25. The spirit of independence among the
                            Mohammedans of Asia Minor, which has characterised the political
                            situation in Turkey for some time, is even beginning to make itself
                            manifest at Constantinople. Thus, the Achiret School at Beshiktesh, a
                            suburb of the Capital where the Imperial quarter of Yildiz is situated,
                            has just been closed in consequence of acts of insubordination by the
                            pupils who have all been sent home. This school was founded for the sons
                            of the chiets of the Kurdish and Arab tribes, hence the name Achiret.
                            One can imagine the effect which this disciplinary mes." sure will
                            produce among the tribes when the news bf the closing of the school
                            becomes known. 1. Many arrests of Musulmans have been affected during
                            the last few days at Constantinople thongh the reason for such is
                            unknown. There are vågue rumours of the discovery of a plot against the
                            Sultan ; at the same time this version is not generally credited. On the
                            other hand, it is believed rather that it concerns false denunciations,
                            .which happen so often in Turkey. Nevertheless, effervescence among the
                            Moslems exists and is fed by the dearness of living. The attitude, for
                            instance, adopted for some time by the Moslem populations of certain
                            Asiatic vilayets, notably those or Ezeroum and Bitlis, against the
                            incapable or venal Valis, has ended by producing a strong impression in
                            the circles of Yildiz. Today again the Moslems of Diyarbekir
                            demonstrated against the local authorities in consequence of the raids
                            by Kurdish tribes and demanded protective measures. Telegraphic
                            communications with Diyarbekir are interrupted and it is believed at
                            Constantinople that the demonstrators, who went to the telegraph office
                            will prevent all communication before the Government has taken steps to
                            punish the Kurds.</p>

                        <p>BRITISH CONSULAR COURT.</p>
                        <p>Judge Cator, of H.B.M. 's Supreme British Consular Court for the
                            dominions of the Sublime Ottoman Porte, commenced on Wednesday at the
                            British Consular Court the hearing of the charge of forgery made by Dr.
                            Noberto Bonetti against Mme. Gardette, a British subject. The plaintiff
                            contended that Mme Gardette had fabricated &amp; document in which Dr.
                            Bonetti appeared as a debtor of £250, while in reality he owed nothing
                            and the document did not emanate from him. Mme. Gardette declared that
                            the document was authentic, all the more so in that it was the renewal
                            of a former one stating the plaintiff owed her the money. The case
                            continued throughout Wednesday and after hearing the evidence of the
                            witnesses for the plaintiff, the witnesses for the defence were heard on
                            Thursday. The latter numbered 15, six of which had been heard when the
                            jury declared to the judge that they had come to the decision that Mme.
                            Gardette was not guilty, the document being quite sincere. The judge
                            said that he agreed with the jury that it was perfectly clear that the
                            document was quite sincere and that, in view of the jury's decision
                            before the conclusion of hearing the witnesses, he did. cleared Mme.
                            Gardette acquitted. The judge added that Dr. Bonetti's plea was most
                            scandalous, but his speech was rendered almost inaudible by the sobs of
                            the acquitted defendant and the murmurs of sympathy from those in Court.
                            Maitre Gottlieb represented the plaintiff and Maitre Sciortino the

                        <p>There were at most half a dozen Europeans assembled among the crowds
                            yesterday afternoon, when the Holy Carpet was borne in state to the
                            Mastaba el Mahmal at the Citadel. The occasion was of the East and
                            conducted by Eastern authorities, and as such it could hardly fail to
                            appeal to those few visitors from the Western Hemisphere who were
                            present. The Citadel itself, Eastern in architecture and surroundings,
                            the calm witness of scenes such as this for nearly eight hundred years,
                            looking placidly down on the seething masses which lined the

                            in smartness by the change, the Infantry, perfect in drill and
                            accoutrement who headed the procession moving as one man, the cavalry
                            with their white steeds equally a mixture of Eastern physiognomy and

                            burthen, these latter with the glamour of the East alone, the scarlet
                            headdresses and the blending colours of the onlooker under a sky of
                            fitful sunshine, gave an impression of the East, which, even in</p>
                        <p>Egypt, the home of romance and ancient -splendour is not often
                            obtainable.</p>
                        <p>The procession arrived at the Citadel at 4 p.m. headed by the second
                            battalion of infantry, and were followed by a detachment of cavalry who
                            immediately preceded the Mahmal borne on a magnificently equipped camel,
                            and surrounded by a guard of civilian natives. Two military bands took
                            part in the procession, and played while the various formalities were
                            being gone through prior to the Carpet being deposited in the Mastaba.
                            Last night there was the usual fete at the Mastaba, and this morning at

                            infected villages on the ground that Mohamedans are forbidden by the

                            accommodates 1st, 2nd, and 3rd. class patients and contains the quarters
                            for the Deaconesses.</p>
                        <p>Next to it follows towards the east a two storied block containing the
                            section for operations. There are two large operating rooms entirely
                            separate from each other for septie Bod aseptic treatment. This block
                            contains on the sheltered side very large kitchens and a boiler house;
                            both in a basement deeply sunk into the ground.</p>
                        <p>Finally we have furthest to the east a separate two storied pavillon.
                            This is intended principally for those diseases which without being
                            contagious necessitate a complete se. paration from the other sections
                            Besides Europeans, it will be mostly natives who will be accommodated
                            here. This block will also contain the Polyclinic. All the building
                            blocks above mentioned will be connected with each other by a covered
                            passage and form thus one whole, easily controlled and yet easily
                            separated from the other sections; a measure which especially in the
                            case of the operating rooms is very wise and of great importance.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the south from the main building just described, we find the
                            isolation wards For infectious diseases. These are placed right against
                            the south boundary far away from the main blocks and at a safe distance
                            from each other, one separate ward for small-pox' and other
                            semi-detached ward for various other liseases. Both these buildings have
                            entirely separate service with male nurses and sisters of their own.
                            Lastly we have the mortuary, a small independent building placed at the
                            south-east corner of the premises.</p>
                        <p>The total area built over will be 4000 square meters after the complete
                            project is carried at. This leaves 16,600 square metres of open space,
                            which will be taken up by gardens, approach roads and courtyards.
                            Without sacrificing too much of the latter, there is therefore room
                            enough for future expansion.</p>
                        <p>The following is the number of beds provided for in the various buildings
                            : Administrative Block, 108 beds; Pavilion, 86 beds, 13</p>
                        <p>194 beds in all for the main buildings, besides 33 beds in the Isolation
                            wards. In times of high pressure, when all the rooms are all up, the
                            hospital can therefore accommodate a total number of about 230 beds. As
                            our readers may already know, the funds or the construction of the new
                            hospital have been principally provided for by the sale of the Id
                            property in Moharram Bey, which was nally concluded early this year with
                            the Société des Entreprises Urbaines" at a highly advantageous
                            price.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately the building rates had, since he original estimates were
                            made, risen to such exorbitant height, that, when the public
                            adjudication for the new hospital took place last summer, it was found
                            that the cost of the ew construction swallowed up the whole capital at
                            the disposal of the committee. They were therefore compelled, very much
                            against their will, to cut off the east pavilion from the present
                            project and decided to postpone its construction to more favourable
                            times in future. But even the "torso" which will be erected now provides
                            considerably more and better accommodation than what can be found in the
                            old hospital.</p>
                        <p>Among the special features which distinguish this hospital from others
                            built in Egypt and which, reserves to it a place among the host modern
                            and complete establishments of is kind in the country, we may

                        <p>We must sincerely congratulate the committee on what has been so far

                    <p>GERMANY NO SODOM.</p>
                    <p>BERLIN, November 29.1 Reichstag. In the debate on the Budget 'rince von
                        Buelow, replying to a reference to the Harden trial, denounced the
                        comparison of the conditions revealed with those of the declining Roman
                        Empire. He said Germany las no Sodom. The purity of the Emperor's fe and
                        house was emblematic of the nation's fe. He ridiculed the possibility of any
                        cama la influencing the Monarch Emperor's self-reliant and independent
                        character.**</p>
                    <p>Heart Stengel, with reference to the Badget, said that the statement that a
                        considerable deficit existed must be faced. The process of improving the
                        imperial finances could not be postponed by the Government. He proposed to
                        effect an improvement by means of indirect taxation. The Budget has been
                        drafted in the spirit of the greatest economy but the economy in the case of
                        the army and navy could become the greatest waste. Admiral Tirpitz
                        explaining the navy bill said that the fleet would be permanently maintained
                        at the high level of other ations.</p>

                    <p>PARIS, November 29. The Chamber passed a resolution calling pon the
                        Government to introduce a so-called organic Navy Bill, that is, a bill
                        extending for a number of years providing for the systematic upkeep and
                        development of the Navy similar to the Gerinah arrangement. M. Thom. She
                        said that Germany constantly modified her programme making serious efforts
                        to oppose ler fleet to the strongest naval Power. It was important therefore
                        that France should not lose time. He did not believe in long building
                        programmes.</p>

                        inst., Mr. F. Legge in the chair. -A paper by Mr.E. R. Ayrton, entitled The

                        lantern slides. In this the author described his discovery, while working
                        for Mr. Theodoro Davis at the Biban el-Molukor Valley of the Kings, of a
                        tomb containing a huge wooden shrine covered with gold-leaf, and bearing an
                        inscription to the effect that it was made by King Khuenaten (the famous
                        "heretic" king)</p>
                    <p>for his mother Queen Thyi. Near it stood a couch, on which was laid a coffin
                        containing a mimmy, which the infiltration of water had reduced to a
                        skeleton. The lid of the coffin bore an erased cartouche, and the lids of
                        the canopic jars containing the viscera, instead of | The usual heads of the
                        tour Genii of the West, were carved into a likeness of the queen. Round the
                        skull was a gold crown in the form of a vulture with displayed wings, which
                        was put on the hind part before. A small part of the usual tomb-furniture
                        was scattered about the tomb, including the instruments used in the ceremony
                        of the "Opening of the Mouth," one of which bore the queen's name. Dr.
                        Elliott Sunith, however, upon examining the remains, pronounced them to be

                    <p>CUSTOMS AND REVENUE.</p>
                    <p>The Custom House in Port Sudan was opened eighteen months ago and great
                        credit is due to Miralai Hayes Sadler Bey, the Director of Sudan Customs,
                        for having so successfully overcome, the many difficulties, which had to be
                        encountered in organising his department, for up to the end of 1905 no
                        Customs Administration existed in the Sudan, The Customs buildings consist
                        of offices and four stores, each 100 by 40 metres. More stores will be
                        subsequently constructed The buildings are of coraline line stone. The local
                        customs are under the control of Mr. Echlin. The organisation of a
                        Statistical Department was begun in February last. Mr. Robinson, the
                        Inspector of Accounts, is engaged on the compilation of elaborate returns
                        for Port Sudan and Suakim and it is intended shortly to publish the returns
                        every month as is done by the Egyptian Customs Administration. -</p>
                    <p>Port Sudan is successfully competing with Mombasa for the Belgian Congo
                        trade. All the imports for the Lado Enclave come by this route and
                        eventually all the Congo trade is expected to come by way of Port Sudan
                        instead of Mombasa. The question as to how the new port competes with the
                        Nile route for imports is interesting. It is found that for imports South of
                        the Atbara, Port Sudan is competing with the old route via Alexandria and
                        the Nile. Last year the imports arriving at Khartoum by this route were
                        practically equal. The gum exports now all come by way of Port Sudan instead
                        of by the Nile with the exception of a very small quantity. For example
                        these exports for the nine months of the present year, from the 1st January
                        to the 30th September, which practically embraces all the gum season,
                        amounted to 7,676,370 kilos via Port Sudan as against 196,000 via Halfa
                        during the same period.</p>
                    <p>CUSTOMS RECEIPTS. The receipts from import duty at Port Sudan from the 1st
                        January up to the 10th inst. amounted to L.E. 25,190, of which Government
                        cargo was responsible for L.E. 12,094. The corresponding totals from import
                        duty during the same period last year was LE. 14,736. The total amount from
                        indirect and direct revenue during this period was L E. 37,550, as against
                        LE. 18,785 during the same time last year.</p>
                    <p>The figures for the three quarters of this year were as follows :</p>
                    <p>January 1st-March 31st. Import Duty. LE. 8,519, as against L.E. 341 for
                        corresponding period last year. Of the import duty L.E. 4,113 were for
                        Government cargo. Export duty, L.E. 320. Tobacco and Tombac, L.E. 614.
                        Total, direct and indirect revenue, LE. 11,766, as against L.E. 1,012 for
                        the first quarter of 1905. The insignificant figures for the preceding year
                        are due the fact that a regular customs administration only came into being
                        in 1906.</p>
                    <p>First and second quarters, from 1st January to 30th June. Import duty, L.E.
                        15,441, as against L.E. 4,692 for the same period in 1906. The Government
                        cargo accounted for L.E. 7,404. Export Duty, LE 717. Tobacco and tombac,
                        L.E. 1,035. Total of direct and indirect revenue, LE 22,753, as against L.E.
                        6,338 for the corresponding six months in 1906.</p>
                    <p>The three quarters up to 30th September. Import duty, L.E. 22,281, as against
                        L.E. 12,084 for the same period in 1906. Of the import duty, Government
                        cargo was responsible for LE. 10,764. Export duty, L.E. 930. The export duty
                        for the first nine months of the preceding year only amounted to L.E. 69
                        Tobacco and tombac, L E. 2,050. Total direct and indirect revenue, LE.
                        33,403, as against LE. 15,463 for the same period in 1906.</p>
                    <p>The import duty on tobacco and tombae at Port Sudan from January 1st up to
                        the 10th inst. totalled L.E. 2,305 as against L.E. 161 for the corresponding
                        time in the preceding year. This large increase is due to the fact that
                        tombac is now cleared at Port Sudan instead of Suakim By special arrangement
                        with Khalil Pasha Khayat, the concessionaire, tombae imported at Suakim pays
                        204 millièmes per oke, of which 160 millièmes go to the Government and 44
                        millièmes to the concessionaire. The actual revenue obtained by the
                        Government from the Suakim imports of tombac from the 1st January to the
                        11th inst. amounted to L.E. 1,458 as against LE 1,858 for the same period
                        last year. The reason is that these imports are now cleared at Port Sudan.
                        It comes from India and the merchants at the latter port only pay 164
                        millièmes per oke.</p>
                    <p>The trade of Suakim will be the subject of a | separate article.</p>
                    <p>Port Sudan, being the port of Khartoum, the following customs returns
                        statistics will be useful. The total revenue, direct and indirect from the
                        Khartoum customs, from the 1st January to the 31st October last, amounted to
                        L. E. 34,191, of which LE, 31,644 were from royalties due from provinces,
                        etc.</p>
                    <p>The export duty during these ten months amounted to L.E. 303. During the same
                        period last year the total revenue amounted to LE. 27,654, of which
                        royalties accounted for L.E. 24,931. The export duty during this time came
                        to L.E. 298.</p>
                    <p>The total revenge of the Halfa customs during these ten months of the present
                        year amounts to LE. 1,845, as against L.E. 1,078 for the same period in
                        1906. Of these totals the paroles post import duty amounted to LE. 1,798 to
                        the 31st alto. as against LE 1,055 for the corresponding ten months last
                        year. In all the above figures it must be remem| bered that there is no
                        fiscal barrier between Egypt and the Sudan, and articles, which have paid
                        duty in Egypt, are admitted free into the Sudan</p>

                        ground was in excellent condition which probably nocounted for the extra
                        good play of the competitors. The first match was between the subalterns of
                        the 60th | Rifles versus the Coldstream Guards subalterns, the latter
                        winning by 4 goals to 3. At the end of the 3rd Chukker the Guards were 41
                        goals to 1, but the both then made a great effort, and, with the Guards
                        being rather too confident, Dearly bought the score level. Mr. Tritton is
                        away just now, and with Sir Walter Barttelot still unable to play on account
                        of his injured arm, the Guards team is not quite representative. Messrs.
                        Bentinek and Tolle mache played a good game for the Guards, and Mr. Watts
                        Rassell has improved considerably. For the 60th Mr. Seymour as usual was the
                        great support to his side, and Mr. Hope at back decidedly did his share. He
                        ought, with his-weight and strength, with regalar practice, to develop into
                        a very strong back. Of the younger players in this Regiment Mr. Saunders
                        might be given encouragement, he has a good eye and some very useful
                        strokes.</p>

                    <p>2ND MATCH. K.S.C. V K.O.S.B. BORDERERS. This was a fast mateb, each side
                        having rups up and down the ground alternately. The K.S.C. won by 4 goals to
                        1. Capt. Sterling played a good, unselfish game at No. 1. Both he and Mr.
                        Merriman, made some excellent "centring" shots. In this respect this mateh
                        was one of the best of the season. There's generally a great tendency to
                        take the ball round. This is a fatal mistake. The K.O.S.B. As a team they
                        are practically free from this great mistake, but the shouting for
                        back-benders can be overdone and once especially they lost a goal in this
                        way.</p>

                    <p>VICTORIA COLLEGE FOOTBALL.</p>
                    <p>On Saturday last a football match took place on the Club ground between
                        Victoria College and the Sporting Club A.F.C. which endell in a win for the
                        home side, four goals nil. The School was not in their best form, being
                        unused to grass. It is very much hoped by the boys of the College that the
                        Sporting Club in the return match will play on the School ground, the
                        College have always had the disadvantage of playing on the Club ground, and
                        if the Club would be sporting enough to play the return match on their
                        opponents ground, then the Club, would get a much better game.</p>

                    <p>THE MAMELUKES LEAP </p>
                    <p>General Tyrrell sends the following to the "Spectator" :</p>
                    <p>It is a pity to spoil a good story, and the story of the Mamelukes famous
                        leap, which is recounted to every visitor to the citadel of Cairo, is a good
                        one But it is a fiction founded on the fact that only a single Mameluke of
                        the seven hundred and odd who were mustered in Cairo on that fatal morning
                        survived the massacre ; but he survived because he was on the sick-list at
                        the time, and was consequently unable to attend the parade in the citadel,
                        and the Pasha, having nothing to fear from a single man, spared his life. A
                        story never loses in the telling in the mouth of an Egyptian, and he is
                        quite capable of inventing one to account for any incident appellation that
                        he does not happen to understand. There were formerly two gates to the
                        citadel of Cairo, called respectively the Gate of the Janissaries and the
                        Gate of the Azabs, from the titles of two Turkish military corps to | whom
                        their charge was confided in. But the existence and the very name of these
                        corps have long been forgotten by the Egyptians, and they accounted for the
                        name Bab el Azab by inventing a story of a saint called Sidi Azab, around
                        whose name a whole legend of marvels and miracles bas grown up, while the
                        little chamber in the gateway formerly occupied as the guardhouse is pointed
                        out as the saint's heritage. By the by, Mr. Knight-Adkin in his stir ring
                        and spirited ballad (Spectator, November 9th) has represented the massacre
                        as occurring when the Mamluks were entering the citadel. It was when they
                        were leaving it that it really occurred. The whole of them had entered into
                        the lane which was their death trap before the gates at each end were closed
                        before and behind them. The spot pointed out as the scene of the Mamelukes
                        leap is on the terre-plein of the citadel.</p>
