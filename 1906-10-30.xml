                    <head>TURKISH SUCCESSION.</head>
                    <p>M. de Lanessan, the eminent director of the "Siècle," has written a
                        remarkable article on the Turkish succession. After referring to the
                        intrigues for altering the legitimate order of succession, and of placing
                        Burhaneddin Effendi, the 22 years old son of Abdul Hamid, on the throne
                        after his father's death, the ex-Minister of the Marine shows that the
                        strong liberal movement in the Ottoman Empire makes the success of such an
                        enterprise more than problematical. M. de Lanessan adds: "So long as Abdul
                        Hamid preserved intact all his physical and mental faculties, his subjects
                        who are yearning for liberty were reduced to silence. To-day they already
                        breathe more freely. After the Sultan's death they will be strong enough,
                        and their number will have increased sufficiently to make it impossible for
                        a palace revolution to prevent the advent to the throne of Reshad Effendi,
                        or to hinder public opinion from pronouncing in favour of the establishment
                        of a constitutional régime. The formula adopted by all the liberal elements
                        of Turkey may be summed up as follows : The establishment of a Liberal
                        Constitution and the protection of the Empire against all the causes of
                        dislocation or destruction with which it may be threatened.</p>
                    <p>"Germany having shown herself to be the auxiliary of Abdul Hamid's abhorred
                        despotism, and not having shown how to restrain her ambitions or cupidity,
                        it is quite natural that the populations of Turkey should distrust her. On
                        the other hand, the sympathies of the Liberals are with France and England,
                        who have constantly shown themselves favourable to the institution of the
                        Liberal régime, and who respect the integrity of the Ottoman Empire. The
                        moment has come for these two Powers to prove their fidelity to the policy
                        which they have always proclaimed. Certainly they would outstep their role
                        by intervening in the internal events which may occur at the moment of Abdul
                        Hamid's death. It belongs to the Liberal Party of the Ottoman Empire to take
                        care that the rights of Reshad Effendi are respected. But the Liberals must
                        know that France and England follow their efforts with lively sympathy and
                        desire their advent to power."</p>
                    <p>Recently a good deal of conflicting information has been published concerning
                        Reshad Effendi, the presumptive heir to the Turkish throne. He has been
                        described by some people so ill with diabetes that he is not likely to
                        survive Abdul Hamid, and by others as being a complete nullity from an
                        intellectual point of view. Reliable information about Reshad Effendi, is
                        supplied by Prince Sebaheddine, whose mother is the sister of both Abdul
                        Hamid and Reshad Effendi, Of all the Turkish refugees in Western Europe he
                        is probably the best qualified man to speak of the presumptive heir to the
                        Ottoman throne, because, with his father, Mahmoud Pasha, he was before his
                        flight to France subjected to much the same sequestration as his uncle.</p>
                    <p>"Reshad Effendi, far from being decrepit, is, said Prince Sebaheddine, both
                        mentally and physically alert. He has, it is true, suffered from diabetes,
                        but the remedies and the precautions he has taken have had the desired
                        effect, so that it is probable it will not be of that malady he will die.
                        Nor is he ignorant of what has taken place during the last thirty years. On
                        the contrary, he has been kept acquainted with everything, and has occupied
                        his mind with study. His moral character is the opposite of that of Abdul
                        Hamid. All the privations inflicted on him during his long years of
                        imprisonment in his palace have not soured his temper or inspired in him a
                        thirst for revenge. On the contrary, Prince Sebaheddine assured me that he
                        would be merciful even to his bitterest enemies, and that his one desire is
                        to give all the races of which, the Ottoman Empire is composed a régime of
                        justice and constitutional liberty insuring their material and moral
                        well-being."</p>
                    <p>He also declared that he did not believe any attempt to place another member
                        of the Imperial family on the throne after the death of Abdul Hamid could be
                        successful. If, for instance, one of the sons of Abdul Hamid were by a
                        palace intrigue proclaimed Sultan, the popular movement against such a
                        usurpation would be so strong as to sweep the illegitimate Sultan away. Fear
                        has been expressed that the Imperial Guard constituted by Abdul Hamid might
                        impose on the Empire the man of their choice as his successor. Prince
                        Sebaheddine does not share that apprehension, because the Imperial Guard is
                        composed chiefly of three conflicting elements: Albanians, Kurds, and Turks.
                        Moreover, it numbers no more than about 12,000 men, and Constantinople is
                        garrisoned by 40,000 regular troops opposed to any sort of modification in
                        the traditional order of succession.</p>

                        Bishop Thornton strongly dissented. As an old Birmingham man he felt
                        indignant at the charge, and said, if true, it was in the highest degree
                        disgraceful. The speaker having given the name of his informant, the Bishop
                        exclaimed, "I will go to Birmingham and thresh this thing out. If there is a
                        firm in the city manufacturing idols for Paganism, I shall expose them to
                        the whole 1 country.” </p>

                    <p>Forty-six arrests have been made in connection with an affray between Saidis
                        and Cairenes in the Sharia Masrouf, Cairo. Twenty persons were injured. The
                        proprietor of a café next door to the one where the riot took place was
                        badly knocked about, his skull being slightly fractured. A waiter in the
                        same café had his right arm broken. The affair seems to have been simply a
                        faction fight, in which nabouts were used with a great disregard of
                        consequences</p>

                    <p>Does the Island of Malta tilt periodically or slowly sway like some gigantic
                        rocking-stone upon some gigantic pivot? For a long time certain phenomena of
                        the tideless sea rising and falling in the harbours and other indications
                        have given rise to the tilt theory. The seismograph ingeniously set up in
                        the past at the dockyard, and recently the beautiful new Milne seismograph,
                        established on the foundation-rock of the University, confirm the preside.

                    <head>THE NOUVEAUTES INCIDENT.</head>
                    <head>YESTERDAY'S EVIDENCE.</head>
                    <p>The hearing of the action brought against M988rs. L. — and G. — by M. Lauri
                        for disorderly conduct and assault on the 21st inst. was concluded
                        yesterday.</p>
                    <p>Further evidence was called by the prosecution and M. Salman was
                        cross-examined by Mr. Le Breton, representing Mr. L.— He stated that he did
                        not himself see defendants throwing chairs, nor was be a witness of the
                        actual assault on the writer.</p>
                    <p>The police witnesses were then called. Constable Antonio Gellal, sworn, gave
                        evidence in Maltese, stating that he was on the box of the carriage which
                        drove away first towards Shepheard's, then to the caracol. He was seized by
                        the tunic by both defendants when they arrived. After this he was struck by
                        &amp; whip. The defendant G.-— hit him and the horses with the whip — some
                        twenty times.</p>
                    <p>Then came the mamour el kism. He said that he was in bed on the night of the
                        affair and was roused by a noise. A policeman made a communication to him.
                        He looked out of the window and saw a scuffle between the police and two
                        Englishmen who were in a cab. He went down and took their names, etc., for
                        the procés verbal. He then went with defendants towards Shepheard's, but as
                        defendants had no money they stopped and went to the St. James's Bar. Their
                        appearance excited remark there. Of the defendants, Mr. L.— was "sakran'
                        awi," the other was more in possession of his faculties. Next day one of the
                        defendants called on him and asked him to give absolutely fair evidence,
                        stating that he did not know what had happened. On Sunday both saw him.</p>
                    <p>After some further evidence the Court asked witness if he had been offered
                        anything by defendants. Witness replied in the negative.</p>
                    <p>Defendants were then sworn, and gave evidence. Mr. G., after giving an
                        inventory of the drinks consumed on the fatal night, and stating that he had
                        a strong head, said that the party did not try to get into the stage
                        entrance bat merely went to find the lavatory. They did not know the
                        arrangements of the theatre. They were not interrupting the performers,
                        merely singing the chorus of "The Old Ball and Bush," a song resembling
                        which was being given.</p>
                    <p>He admitted pushing the waiter out because the waiter breathed on him and put
                        his hands, which were dirty, on his clothes. Mr. L. was sitting with his
                        legs over the box because he had no room in the box. Neither was drunk. He
                        admitted thrusting the proprietor out. As for the scuffle, the crowd hustled
                        and attacked them. At the caracol there was an excited crowd, and as he had
                        been knocked about, and did not want to leave the carriage because of their
                        demeanor, he took the reins and hit the horses with his whip to get the
                        carriage away. Some of his blows may have struck a policeman, but he did not
                        mean to hit any person. Witness said he spoke no Arabic or French. Mr.L—, on
                        being sworn gave a similar account. He said that he remembered very little,
                        having been hit on the head in the scuffle. After the waiter was put out of
                        the box the party left, but then someone said "it's all right now" and they
                        went back. He did not know what had happened, nor why they left the box.</p>
                    <p>Evidence for the defence emphasised the gesticulations of the waiter and the
                        excitement of the crowd. Mr. Le Breton, on behalf of Mr. L— pleaded that his
                        client had not been proved guilty of any assault.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Alban stated that the defendants had been guilty of disgraceful conduct
                        and that he considered that the case against them had been fully made out.
                        He would sentence them to 14 days' imprisonment each without the option of a
                        fine.</p>

                    <head>THE NEW MINISTER.</head>
                    <head>NATIVE PRESS COMMENTS.</head>
                    <p>On Sunday Saad Bey Zagleul, the new Minister of Education, had a private
                        audience with the Khedive, and, returning to Cairo the same evening, paid
                        visits to the Ministers and Advisers, from all of whom he received hearty
                        congratulations on his new appointment.</p>
                    <p>It is confidently expected that the Khedive will shortly con for the rank of
                        Mirmiran upon the new Minister, who will then hold the same grade as his
                        fellow ministers.</p>
                    <p>It is also rumoured that Yacoub Pasba Artin, Under-Secretary of State of
                        Education, will resign shortly.</p>
                    <p>The following are translations of the comments of the native Press on the new
                        appointment. </p>
                    <p>Most important Ministry.</p>
                    <p>From "Al Mokattam":—The Ministry of Public Instruction is perhaps the most
                        important of all the ministries, and there is ample room for reform. It
                        cannot be doubted that this ministry has in the past done everything
                        possible for the advancement of education in this country, and Saad Bey
                        Zagloul himself acknowledged this when the circular of the provisional
                        committee for the establishment of a national university was issued......
                        The people of the country will now look to Saad Bey Zaglool to devote his
                        talent and his energy to the progression of public education in such a way
                        as to gain the satisfaction of the nation. </p>
                    <p>A Welcome Augury.</p>
                    <p>"Al Moayad":—Diring the past eleven years our Ministry has remained the same,
                        impassable on account of its inaction, always tranquil, and always
                        identical; up to the present all power has fallen upon the English Advisers.
                        Bat now we have been wakened with a start. A loud bang has roused us from
                        our torpor; it concerns a new "combination" in our ministry. This
                        combination instills in us new hope, for we can only attribute it to the
                        desire of the Sovereign and his Advisers to render to the Ministers a
                        certain measure of their old powers. After what has happened among us to
                        make the Egyptians discontented, we would hope that instructions to that
                        effect have been given by the English Minister for Foreign Affairs… It is to
                        his eminent virtues, the independence of his character, and his personal
                        dignity that Saad Bey Zagloul owes his promotiou to this high post.</p>
                    <p>Suggested by Prime Minister.</p>
                    <p>"Al Minbar":—Some people may consider that the new Minister cannot fail to
                        follow in the footsteps of his colleagues in his relations with the Adviser,
                        bat we are of the opinion that Mr. Danlop cannot but co-operate with such a
                        Minister as Saad Bey Zagloul for the advancement of the nation by ever
                        raising the standard of education. Some persons are of the opinion that the
                        appointment of Saad Bey Zagloul was suggested by Mustapha Pasha Febmy, whose
                        chief aim has always been to avoid any strained relations between the
                        English and Egyptians, and it is also rumoured that the Prime Minister will
                        shortly resign with the object of facilitating the accession of Saad Bey
                        Zagloul to the presidency of the Council of Ministers.</p>
                    <p>Extent of Power.</p>
                    <p>"Al Ahram":—In some quarters it is thought that Saad Bey Zagloul's
                        appointment is a forerunner of the resignation of Mustapha Pasha Febmy,
                        while others say that Lord Cromer, having taken to heart the criticisms
                        passed upon the policy of education in Egypt, has appointed Saad Bey Zagloul
                        to satisfy the public. We are of the opinion that if the government, who has
                        overlooked Ibrahim Pasha Naguib, Ismail Pasha Sabri, Artin Pasha, and Saleh
                        Pasha Sabet, means to give Saad Bey Zagloul, whose talent makes him deserve
                        the post, freedom in the education and the organisation of the Ministry, the
                        appointment will prove an excellent one, but, otherwise, a new Minister, who
                        is allowed to do nothing, would give satisfaction to nobody.</p>
                    <p>An Effect of Denishwai.</p>
                    <p>"Al Lewe":—The appointment of Saad Bey Zaglool is an after-effect of the
                        Denishwai incident, which caused the Egyptians to show how they shrink from
                        the British Occupation, which robs them of their independence and influence.
                        But the new departure will please none of us unless Saad Bey Zagloul is
                        allowed freedom of action in his new post. The new Minister should at once
                        seize the opportunity to prove his er energy and talent.</p>

                        <head>"SERGEANT BRUE.”</head>
                    <p>"Sergeant Brue" proved to be less uninteresting than its two predecessors;
                        but again we have to complain that it is but a one-man piece, and is as full
                        as any of its kind of songs which have no sort of reference to the action.
                        These we can sometimes pardon “While you wait" and "Ha, ha, ha, he, he, he"
                        both gave Mr. Cole a good ILLEGIBLE, and he used it to effect. Mr. Cole,
                        indeed, did his best all through, and accentuated such points as his part
                        contained to the utmost, Miss Corlass hardly had a fair chance but she, too,
                        made much of a most colourless part. Mr. Will Smith was good as the low-down
                        "man of all work." The best song from a vocal and musical point of view was
                        Mr. Attwell's “Eyes of Blue," through the "Congo," by Miss Morra, and the
                        "Isle of Erin," by Miss Leslie, were both very fairly given.</p>
                    <p>The orchestra was rather weird at times, but possibly that may have been
                        intended by the composer. It is rather a hopeless case for English musical
                        comedy of to-day, if "Sergeant Broe" and "The Catch of the Season" are to be
                        taken as representative; and the company have a hard task before them if
                        "The Little Michus" and the other more modern pieces are no better. They
                        have shown in “The Runaway Girl" what they can do, and it is unfortunate
                        that their talents should be wasted on stuff so second-rate and loosely put
                        together as the pieces we allude to.</p>

                        <head>"THE LITTLE MICHUS."</head>
                    <head>(BY TELEPHONE.) </head>
                    <p>The "Little Michus" was a great success last night, not only as a performance
                        but as a play. It is in itself much above the usual standard of musical
                        comedy; in fact, it is far more of the operetta, with a certain amount of
                        musical dialogue, and even recitative, which is well put together, the parts
                        being properly balanced, and the music being not only tasteful, but full of
                        characterisation. Perhaps the most charming song of all was the duet between
                        the Michus, addressed to St. Valentine.</p>
                    <p>Miss Corlass was at her best, and her voice, always delightful, was
                        exceptionally so in this number. Mr. Harry Cole, as usual, repeatedly
                        brought down the house. "Break Away" was an excellent piece of advice both
                        to father and daughter, whom he surprises embracing their respective lovers.
                        Mr. Will Smith was in much better form than we have yet seen him; the part
                        gave him a fair chance and he profited by it. Mr. Attwell, too, did
                        exceedingly well. </p>
                    <p>The only criticism one could make was that now and again the performance was
                        a little bit ragged in the ensemble parts, the dialogue, and once or twice
                        the chorus, but then, as we have said, the music is of very different
                        character and arrangement to that of the average comedy. The piece is very
                        charming, and all who were present greatly appreciated the performance.</p>

                        them by the local Omdeh. The Mamour strained every nerve to maintain order
                        and security during the stay of the troops, and all the arrangements were
                        perfect. The column, after expressing their warm thanks to the authorities,

                        most excellent work has been done by the soldiers employed on the railway.
                        The rails are laid as far as kilometre 720. From this point up to kilometre
                        748 the building of forty bridges and tunnels was left entirely to the
                        soldiers, and they have carried out the work most satisfactorily. Eight of
                        the bridges were built in a fortnight. An economy of L. T. 8,000 has been
                        realized by employing soldiers, who will carry out all the engineering works
                        as far as Medina. A tunnel 160 metres long will be built near the station of
