                    <p>EXPULSION OF A SHEIKH</p>
                    <p>Considerable discussion has been aroused in native circles by the treatment
                        of Sheikh Razi, one of the ulema of the Al Azhar University at the last
                        reception held by H H the Khedive. It is averred that the learned Sheikh was
                        peremptorily ordered by the Grand Master of Ceremonies to quit the Palace
                        and that instructions were issued to the soldiers of the Khedivial guard and
                        to the police responsible for this gentleman's entrance to furbid bius
                        Admission in the future. However this may be, the Sheikh left Abdin in high
                        dudgeon and it can only be supported that the disfavour of His Highness was
                        the cause of his expulsion. Abbas II is unlikely to have ordered the
                        expulsion of an Alim from the Palace, above all on an occasion on which all
                        the Moslem world is en fête, without good reasons and the report that Sheikh
                        Razi had been guilty of proposing almost revolutionary measures dignified by
                        enemies of the ancient and celebrated Moslem: University with the title of
                        Schemes for reform'-which were highly displeasing to his fellow Ulems seems
                        to us to restore some solid foundation. In any case we may be assured that
                        H. H. the Khedive-who has in any case a perfect right to refuse to receive
                        persons in wbom be bas no confidence is too far above the tumult of party
                        strife and too inground in the pursuit not of his private but of the public
                        interest, to have instructed his Grand Master of the Ceremonies to take any
                        such action for merely personal reasons. At the same time we regret that no
                        measures were taken to warn Sheikh Razi before the neweption that his
                        presence at Abdin was not desired. for any such incident - which loses
                        nothing in the telling-is to be regretted, more especially when it occurs

                    <p>HIS DEPARTURE FROM EGYPT.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Rutherford, MP, left Cairo yesterday morning for Port Said in order to
                        return home in time for the opening of Parliament. When leaving be cordially
                        thanked his friends who came to the station to bid him farewell, for all the
                        attentions that had been shown to him and for the beautiful and costly
                        jewels sod treasures, which bis admirers had bestowed upon him. He also
                        expressed his warm appreciation of the universal urbanity, with which he had
                        been received by the British officials and the facilities afforded him by
                        Dr. Dunlop sod bis eminent Anglo-Boption colleges for pouring his
                        investigations into educational and other administrative mysteries. Mr.
                        Rotberford spent Sunday on a visit to Mansonnab. He was specially struck
                        with the ability and intelligence of Mustapha Pasha Maber, the popular
                        Moudir tberg, whose intellectual capacity and liberal sympathie deeply
                        impressed the Scotch Radical M.P. Here he noted, was at all events a B and
                        an Egyptian, who was ripe for self-government. Dr. Rutherford. M.P.,
                        reflected that conceivably there might be many others like him, scattered
                        throughout the length and breadth of the country, who had attained the same
                        high level of mental capacity. From sub examples be derived mueb
                        encouragement for bi pet theory that a larger share of Government and
                        responsibility should be conferred upon the Egyptian people. Accompanied by
                        the Moudit, the MP., visited the primary and technical schools, and made
                        detailed and exhaustive inspection of these educational establishments. He
                        also sawa girls sebool, which much pleased him. The want, however, of a
                        secondary school at Mar south was strongly commented upon by him. Dr.
                        Rutherford has been favourably impressed with all that he has seen, but his
                        visit, so far as could be gleaned, has not obliged his political a priori
                        intentions on the difficult theory of Egyptian Administration. He has made a
                        deep study of Egypt in books and reports and has digested the voluminous an
                        bual reports of Lord Cromer with amazing scrupulousness His fortnight's
                        visit to this country will therefore give him . panoply for entering the
                        arena of parliamentary debate fully primed to deal with every detail of
                        Egypt in Administration, which comes before the notice of the House of
                        Commons. He will be able to ask most searching questions about Egypt's
                        internal organisation and will ply Sir Edward Grey with crucial problems to
                        technical details of management and control Dr. Rutherford, M.P., is of
                        somewhat reserved character and does not unburthe himself to the
                        pertinacious interviewer However, as far as we can gather, the above
                        represents our intelligent anticipation of what is likely to take place.

                        another room leading out of the restaurant to accomodate the guests Miss
                        Cochrane who generally entertains guests on Saturday nights had a larger
                        party than usual: among them being Colonel and Mos Herbert Mr. and MrsRoyle

                        Byre. At Count Koti Brodsky's table were ibe Marquis Moravanti, Baron

                        relatives. If any proof was needed to show how the son has improved of late,
                        a glimpse into the ballroom later on would have been sufficient to convince
                        pessimists that there is plenty of life even now in Cairo. It was perhaps
                        the most festive function we have seen this winter, and we hear that some of
                        the supper parties might still have been found in the restaurant till close
                        upon three o'clock in the morning. There were some very noticeable toilettes
                        to be seen during the evening, that of Mme Sersoek being especially

                    <p>To The EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE”</p>
                    <p>Dear Sir,- A Cairo correspondent of the continental "Daily Mail," writing
                        from Cairo in December, calls attention to the continuance of financial
                        depression in Egypt and points out that the want of ready money is affecting
                        all classes and nationalities in the country and continues "The fall in
                        market values which met in last March has continued, land owners who sold
                        their cotton early in the year have been paid only in part while in the
                        share market securities which were quoted at £5 or £6 are now offered at
                        about £1. Complaint is made in European business circles that the Banks are
                        attempting nothing to relieve the situation. The Government is criticised
                        for its passive attitude......... "The crisis has touched the national
                        prosperity to a severe degree." All the above is most certainly true, and
                        unfortunately there appears to be no prospect of affairs righting themselves
                        as we anticipated in the new year. Rents continue to stand at exorbitant
                        figures, living becomes more expensive daily, and money is as tight to-day
                        as it was in the early days of the crisis. The banks refuse to make advances
                        now on the security of stock to people whose signature would have been
                        considered sufficient a year ago. To put the whole thing in few words every
                        man doubts the financial stability of his neighbour with the result that a
                        feeling of distrust prevails throughout the whole business community of
                        Cairo, and until money is forced into circulation by some means or other
                        there can be no prospect of renewed prosperity. There are rumours of the
                        Government being called upon to relieve the situation by loan of two million
                        to the country. It Is likely that the Government will consider a pro
                        position of this kind, and if it did would the loan be of any real service
                        to the country at large It would of course tend to keep things going for the
                        time being, but would it be of any material assistance to the guarantee of
                        financial security in the future. I for one doubt fit, it might keep the
                        heads of several of our too numerous companies above water and it would
                        certainly keep the rents at their present exorbitant standard. Would this be
                        an advantage! I think not </p>

                        of both communities This naturally caused partial cowtion of official

                        former, have spent much of their holiday time in driving in and about the
                        towns. This seems to be a specially popular form of amusement st such times

                    <p>Concert At Nicola</p>
                    <p>A grand concert was given on the 10th instant at the Papadopoullos Theatre,
                        Nicosia, "In sid of Consumptive Pend." The performance was held under the
                        patronage of his Excellency the High Commissioner and Lady King Harman, who
                        were present. The boom was unfortunately, by no means full have seen it, but
                        the expec could not have been heavy. It may be hoped that a ti fotory sum
                        was nevertheless, realised to be placed to the credit of the Pand. The
                        entertainment provided was good, and though not very varied in character,
                        was very creditable to the small baglish community, who with one exception
                        supplied the musical talent on the occasion. Particularly noteworthy was the
                        really fine duet for two pianos most excellently played by Mr. G. Smith and
                        Mo Ami rayan. The performance WM was almost faultless and both ladies

                        were much enjoyed and heartily appland ed. The programme was completed by
                        excellent songs from Col. Gore, Capt. Durham Hall, Rev. F. LIEdwarda, and
                        Mr. &amp;. Since the existence of the Nicosia Pamagosta Railway it has
                        become customary for Pema gusta residents to train to Nicosia for any
                        entertainment of this sort and to return to their district theme night. This
                        provides them with • pleasant opportunity of taking part in historical
                        events at the capital and at the me time adds materially to the taking of

                        This event is molly fixed for Kourbam Bair , which, being a moveable feast
                        occurring a fortnight earlier every year, has brought it about that this
                        Show is now being held in the depth of the Winter. In course of time
                        presumably thin feast will take place in the setumn instead of the winter,
                        and the Animal Show Mociated with it will then fall close upon the Omodne
                        Animal Show, which is regular fixture fre the 27th September. Doubtlen
                        arrangement will be made to obviate this, but, under present conditions, not
                        a few livestock owners must be deterred from showing their apmak by a
                        reasonable objection to exposing them to the biting wind, which so often
                        prevails, wit has done to day, at this time of year.</p>

                    <p>“TO THE EDITOR OF THE EGYPTIAN GAZETTE"</p>
                    <p>Sir,-Is there no authority in the city which can put a stop to the cruelty
                        perpetrated under our very eyes? One constantly sees live pigeons, fowls,
                        and ducks tied tightly by the legs hawked about the streets for sale. How
                        long they are kept in this torture heaven alone knows, but the agony they
                        must endure is undeniable. This day in the Rue Cherif Parba I saw a native
                        offering for sale on 19 or 15 live wild ducks tied in benches by the lege
                        with cord sad slang over beholder Presumably some of these wretched bride
                        would remain in this position the whole day and being wild their leg
                        wooldsboetied until some prohor bad pait need to their offerings Baskets
                        made from the items of palm le you are within the road of all hati and
                        Invention to think that if there be my Authority with power to omog roh
                        order no native should be allowed to hawk live birde or simal except in
                        baskets of suitable size</p> 
                    <p>Yours faithfully</p>
                    <p> Alexandria, January 21, 1908 </p>
