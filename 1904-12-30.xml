                        <head>THE PILGRIMAGE. </head>
                        <p>The ceremony of the Kisweh, which takes place to-morrow, is a significant
                            reminder of the approach of the annual pilgrimage. Various
                            considerations arise, amongst them being the somewhat important one of
                            finance. According to the regulations, which were recently issued, it
                            would appear that there is to be some increase, and in the case of
                            third-class passengers a considerable augmentation, in the deposit to
                            cover cost of conveyance to be demanded by the Government. This year LE
                            25 has to be deposited for the first-class, L.E. 22 for the second-class
                            and L.E. 18 for the third-class. The charges, taken as a whole, appear
                            to us to be too high. From enquiries that we instituted on a previous
                            occasion, it was found that a pilgrim, who even took the longest route,
                            could manage to go to the Holy Places and back for a sum much smaller
                            than that which is now exacted. Besides which, he was not put to the
                            inconvenience of making any deposit, but could make his own bargains and
                            could pay the money as the occasion demanded. In a year when there is no
                            reason to expect any infectious disease to emanate from the usual
                            sources, there is no valid reason for the exaction of a larger sum as a
                            deposit than the actual passage money, which from Jeddah is a mere
                            pittance. We have never yet been able to discover the advantages which
                            pilgrims have derived by the Government insisting upon a change of
                            route. To us it has always appeared an unwarrantable interfere-</p>

                        <p>ence with the liberty of the subject, against which we have not failed to
                            enter aforetimes our earnest protest. If sanitary reasons are alleged as
                            a justification, then any possible contamination would be avoided by a
                            thoroughly strict quarantine at Tor. To this we have every reason to
                            believe no opposition would be offered by those attending the
                            pilgrimage. That difficulty is therefore easily surmounted. But another
                            reason has been put forward for the stringency of the regulations, and
                            that is that the pilgrims should receive adequate protection. The
                            precautions that are to be taken this year owing to the increase of the
                            escort may possibly be adequate, but considering that Arabia is by no
                            means in a tranquil state, there are not sufficient guarantees against a
                            petition of the terrible scenes which occurred during last year's
                            pilgrimage.</p>

                    <div type="subsection">
                        <head> THE OFFICIAL JOURNAL </head>
                        <p> The National Printing Office is advertising a sale of waste paper for
                            the year 1905, amounting to three or four tons a month, but that does
                            not include the regular publication of the Journal Officiel, which does
                            waste a great amount of paper. The Journal Officiel sadly needs reform
                            in economising space. The Survey Department notices could not be made
                            shorter and still maintain the clear tabular form which shows at a
                            glance all the information to be conveyed. The Custom House lists are
                            equally clear. The Public Works public general conditions of contracts
                            and the special contracts follow, but in these there is far too much
                            repetition of information which might be given once for all. The Post
                            Office Wastes space over lost Savings Bank books. The Railway
                            Administration do not open a small telegraph office or stop a train at
                            an additional station without inordinate announcement. The Ministry of
                            Finance, when they sell a few feddans of land, usually spread
                            themselves. If they had general conditions announced once in each
                            publication of the Journal it would not matter, but for each sale there
                            is endless reiteration and the real matter is concealed and buried,
                            Worst of all, when one has waded through a long notice to find what is
                            really being sold, there is only a number indicating the lot, and one is
                            referred to the Journal Officiel No. 99 of 6th Sept. 1902 for the
                            clauses and conditions of sale. The Same Ministry, in letting land,

                            <p> Reuter's correspondent with the besiegers states that when the
                                Japanese captured Erhlung-shan Fort they had 1,000 casualties. Seven
                                dynamite mines were exploded at 10 o'clock yesterday morning,
                                breaches thus being made in the front wall, through which a large
                                body of troops charged, uuder cover of a tremendous bombardment.
                                They captured the first line of guns, and a bitter fight then
                                ensued, which resulted in the capture of the whole fort by
                                night-time. The garrison consisted of 500 men, of whom a third
                                escaped. (Reuter.)</p>

                        <p>An interesting ceremony took place at the Khedivial Hotel, Alexandria,
                            last night, when Maitre Demetriades, of the Mixed Courts, gave a banquet
                            in honour of the appointment of Mr. Wakeman Long to a judgeship of 1st
                            Instance in the Native Tribunals. Among those present were Mr. Briscoe,
                            the leader of the English Bar at Alexandria, Maitre Caloyanni and Mr.
                            Preston, of the British Consular Bar and the Mixed Courts, Maitre Mario
                            Vella, of the Mixed Courts, Mr. Frederick Leveaux, of the British
                            Consular Bar, Cairo, etc. After an excellent repast Maitre Demetriades,
                            the genial host, gave a most touching valedictory panegyric on the high
                            professional attainments, stern sense of duty, and other qualities which
                            have gained for Judge Long the esteem and respect of a large circle of
                            friends and acquaintances at Alexandria.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Demetriades' discourse was followed by an eloquent address by Maitre
                            Mario Vella, who confined his speech to the great reputation which Judge
                            Long had won at the Mixed Courts,</p>
                        <p>Mr. Briscoe then rose and, in the name of his English colleagues at
                            Alexandria, bewailed the loss which Egypt's commercial capital was about
                            to sustain.</p>
                        <p>The guest of the evening replied in suitably modest terms in regard to
                            the encomiums of the preceding speakers. He referred to the kind manner
                            in which he had been received by his colleagues, and to the cordial
                            relations which had always existed between his learned brethren and
                            himself. He went on to say that he had no doubt that his successor would
                            be treated in the same kind manner, and expressed his regret that
                            forensically his connection would be severed, but he assured his
                            attentive hearers that he would always retain those ties of friendship
                            and professional respect, which bound him to Alexandria. He referred to
                            the exalted position he was about to occupy in the Egyptian Government
                            service, and stated that he entered upon his new duties in the spirit of
                            a law student--that aspect of a lawyer's career which would remain with
                            him to the end of his days, no matter to what eminence he attained--and
                            quoted the remark of Lord Justice Bowen, one of England's greatest
                            judges, who was wont to say that he had been a law student for 40 years
                            and would remain a law student as long as he lived.</p>
                        <p>Maitre Caloyanni then added his testimony to the general ability and
                            courtesy of his learned friend and late colleague, and proceeded to draw
                            an interesting comparison between the procedure and methods of English
                            jurisprudence and that of other countries, where the Code Napoleon and
                            Roman Law had been adopted.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Preston followed with a humorous speech, and confirmed what Judge
                            Long had said as to the invariable sympathy and ungrudging help he had
                            received at the hands of his colleagues when starting in practice in
                            Egypt, referring particularly to the kindness and geniality of Mr.
                            Briscoe, whose health he proposed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Briscoe replied in fitting terms. The party did not disperse until a
                            late hour, after a very pleasant and interesting evening.</p>

                        <p>Suez, Thursday.---The British India steamer "Ismailia,” which arrived at
                            Suez this morning from India, had on board the captain and crew of the
                            Portuguese transport "Sao Thome," which was wrecked in the Red Sea on
                            the evening of the 24th November last. The transport "Sao Thome” was a
                            vessel of 1,485 tons register, owned by the Empreza Nacional Naviga cao,
                            and under the command of Captain Jose Antono dos Reus. She had been
                            chartered by the Portuguese Government for the conveyance of naval and
                            military details, ammunition, and guns from Lisbon to Macao, and at the
                            time of the wreck had 335 naval and military officers and men on board,
                            in addition to her crew, numbering 76 all told.</p>
                        <p>At 7 o'clock in the evening of the 24th ult., in clear and fine weather,
                            the steamer ran at full speed on a coral reef on the Farisan bank, not
                            far off the Arabian coast, in the Red Sea. An Arab pilot had been taken
                            to assist in navigating the transport down the Red Sea, and the vessel
                            at the time was making for Perim Straits.</p>
                        <p>The officers were at dinner when the crash came, the "Sao Thomes" bows
                            being carried up high by the force of the impact. This is considered to
                            have in a manner helped to keep the vessel afloat for a few days. On the
                            evening of the 17th ult., the crew and troops were saved by the S.S.
                            "Clan Mackay" (Cap. Higgins) and conveyed to Aden. A few days later the
                            "Sao Thome" became a total wreck.</p>

                            Ruotolo discovered that he was no longer impresario. Very properly they
                            refused to appear, so for the present there are no performances at the

                    <head>EGYPTIAN SHARE MARKET</head>
                    <head>(FROM OUR FINANCIAL CORRESPONDENT)</head>
                    <dateline>London, December 23.</dateline>
                    <p> Stocks and shares have during the present week been little influenced by
                        other considerations than the coming Christmas holidays. The black fog of
                        the good old "pea-soup” order, which has prevailed continuously for the last
                        three days and nights, has also kept many of the principal dealers and
                        brokers away ; consequently there is no chance of the market shaking off the
                        holiday garb until the middle of next week. Since our last much has taken
                        place in the political world which must sooner or later have its effect on
                        stock exchange values. According to reliable information, the Powers are
                        sadly disappointed at recent events in Russia. The heads of the Church have
                        played into the hands of the War Party by using their influence to prevent
                        the Tsar from even encouraging the pioneers of reform, as was his personal
                        wish ; so for the present matters have come to a deadlock. If something is
                        not done soon to appease the increasing discontent, we shall see an
                        upheaval, the consequence of which, to Russia, will be too dreadful to
                        contemplate.</p>
                    <p>All this is retarding the long-wished-for peace. The European Powers
                        recognise that if the end of the war is to result in a lasting peace, and
                        not to be followed by another war nearer home, and possibly in Asia also,
                        then the Powers must have a voice in the final settlement, and all must be
                        in accord therewith.</p>
                    <p>As regards the course of prices this week, there is little of interest to
                        tell. Egyptian stocks have been, and are still, dull. Agricultural Banks are
                        as low as 9 1/4 and Nationals 21 1/4. Land shares are also easier and Salt
                        and Sodas are a fraction lower at 1 3/4. Daira Sugar are almost the only
                        things which have held their price, keeping firm at 5 15/16, and in face of
                        the dividend just declared are worth buying. The Corporation announce that a
                        dividend at the rate of 3s. per share, less income tax, was declared at the
                        meeting yesterday, payable to holders of share warrants to bearer, on
                        presentation of coupon No. 3, by Messrs. Glyn, Mills, Currie &amp; Co. on
                        and after to-day. The Nile Valley report was not considered altogether
                        satisfactory and the price fell to 2 5/16 the probability of a further issue
                        of shares (part of the unissued capital) being also an adverse factor. At
                        the same time it must be borne in mind that the shares are now in very
                        strong hands, and consequently we are sure to see the development of the
                        mine pushed forward with energy and in a proper manner. The present price,
                        therefore, should offer a fair speculative chance, especially as the general
                        expectation is that we shall see good mining markets early in the New Year.
                        In the foreign market the recent sale in Russian stock has caused a certain
                        amount of uneasiness in Paris. The internal state of affairs in Russia is
                        certainly curious, and should trouble arise there, the effect on speculative
                        markets, through Paris, might be severe. Barring this, the outlook is good,
                        and as far as London is concerned markets are wonderfully good in tone and
                        tendency, although we must not expect much activity until the holidays and
                        the effect thereof have worn off.</p>

                        <p>Owing to the extreme difficulty experienced at this time of the year in
                            getting together a representative eleven, the game arranged between "C"
                            Company, Royal Berks, and the Saint Andrew Football Club, has been
                            postponed till the 7th of January,</p>
                        <p>This same difficulty was encountered last week, but the match between the
                            Army Temperance Association and Saint Andrews, having been already
                            postponed one week, was played off. Saint Andrews did what they could,
                            putting a scratch eleven on the field, but not half of the players were
                            members of the club. In spite of this fact, however, and the inclemency
                            of the weather, the game was a good one. The Army Temperance team played
                            splendidly, but the condition of the ground latterly somewhat upset the
                            calculations of the players. The “Seats" were the first to open the
                            score, but shortly before half-time, and after some tussling, the Army
                            Temperance managed to get a goal from a corner kick. At half-time the
                            score stood one all. Towards the end of the second half the play was not
                            quite so balanced, the homesters having rather the best of the game.
                            They eventually scored another goal, thus being able to claim a victory
                            of two goals to one.</p>

                        <p>After a fast game, in which the Khedivia team showed better footwork and
                            combination than their opponents, the Tewfikia boys were yesterday
                            beaten by 4 goals to 1. In the first half the Khedivia scored 2 goals to
                            nil. The Tewfikia had more of the play in the second half and scored a
                            goal towards the finish. There was a large and enthusiastic audience of
                            pupils and old boys, and the grand-stand was full of visitors, among
                            whom we may mention the Earl of Cromer, the Minister of Public
                            Instruction, Mr. Dunlop, Mr. and Mrs. Elliot, Mr. and Mrs. Sharman, Mr.

                        <p>The above teams met for the first time this season, at Ras-el-Tin
                            yesterday. From the start the gunners pressed hard and very soon found
                            the net. Half time came with the score : R. M. A. 4, R. A. M. C., nil.
                            In the second half the R. A.M. C. played a better game but were unable
                            to score. Result: R. M. A. 7 goals, R. A. M. C., nil.</p>

                        <p>These teams were opposed at Sidi Gaber on Wednesday. E. T. C. started
                            down the slope, and three minutes from the start got their first goal.
                            Nothing further was scored until close on half-time, when Thurston found
                            the net from a fine centre by Blythman. Halftime E. T.C. 2, Berks 0. The
                            second half proved more even, only one goal being scored, and that by
                            the Berks, from a melee in front of goal. Incledon played a fine game
                            for the Exiles. Result E. T. C. 2, Berks 1.</p>
                        <p>The following played for the E. T. C.: Goal, Harrison; backs, Lees and
