                        science has yet achieved. They provide, when used as directed, a complete

                        strong bones; and are so graduated as to give the maximum quantity of

                        therefore safer than and superior to, cow's milk, especially in hot weather.
                        The Milk Foods are made instantly by the simple addit of hot water only, and
                        are alike suitable for the delicate infant and the child in robust health,

                    <head>The New Khartoum</head>
                    <p>Sir Walter Mieville, K C.M.G., contributes an interesting article under the
                        above heading to the current number of the "XIXth Century Magazine," in
                        which he describes the enormous, changes which have taken place in the town
                        during recent years, and concludes his remarks with a suggestion as how best
                        to overcome the evil of under population which is now the only real
                        deterrent to the assured prosperity of the country. The changes which have
                        been wrought since the downfall of the Mahdi are indeed | remarkable, for
                        the years which have passed since that time form a very small span in the
                        life of a country, and yet at the present day, evidences of the savagery
                        which obtained under the despotic rule of the Madhi, and his even more
                        tyrannical successor the Khalifa, are seldom met with and the inhabitants of
                        the Sudan appear to have taken hold of the new civilization with a grasp and
                        understanding which it is not usual to find in such cases. When one
                        considers the numberless inhabitants of the country to whom the days of the
                        Madhi and Khalifa are a living and no remoto reality, it will be admitted
                        that the march of events has progressed with a rapidity far greater than we
                        had any cause to expect. Under their former masters, even though not
                        frequently subjected to the harshest and most unjust cruelty, the native was
                        aborted with a much broader licence than that which obtains in the present
                        day when there are police courts and strictly enforced Government
                        regulations to be considered. But the Sudanese, the real dark skinned
                        Sudanese of the Egyptian Sudan, is, taking him all through a sharp witted
                        fellow, and finding that the occupation of his country by a foreign horde
                        was an inevitable and se accomplished fact, he resigned himself to the new
                        order of things with &amp; philosophical calmness, and a determination to
                        take the goods which the gods had given him, and incidentally anything else
                        which might happen to fall in his way, without question and with a thankful
                        heart Years of previous mistake had also produced their effect upon hin and
                        rendered his mind more receptive to the new order of things which demanded
                        no labour without reward, and which lett even the lowest of his countrymen
                        in actual and undisputed possession of his wife and property provided that
                        he behaved himself and conformed to the best of his abilities to the new
                        regulations of justice. And regarding the new military service which was
                        demanded of him, the display and glitter, the clanging boots and the brass
                        bound belts, appealed to his native love of display And ceremony with a
                        power which was all suf. ficient to turn him at once into a loyal soldier of
                        the conquerors army, while the rivalry between the various battalions
                        sufficed to ensure an early proficiency in the arts required of him. Thas
                        the task which fell to the lot of the invaders was considerably lessened
                        even in the first days of their occupation of the country, for, the loyal
                        cooperation of the natives having been gained, the rest was comparatively
                        speaking easy, and the developments which have followed have been more or
                        less natural, though it has of course been necessary that the guiding hand
                        should never be released from the wheel even for the remotest period of
                        time. The growth of the City of Khartoum has been both rapid and well
                        ordered, the mistake of over crowding which is so frequently inade in the
                        laying out of a new town has been avoided here, and Khartoom is not only
                        supplied with houses of a comfortable and serviceable description, they are
                        also built with a dee regard to the advantages of roomy surroundings. The
                        streets are broad and well laid out with shrubs and trees on either side,
                        and the public buildings are built for the most part to appropriate designs,
                        thought it must be admitted that the building work in some of these offices
                        has been slipshod in the extreme, and that more than one of the larger of
                        the public buildings stand as a disgrace to the authorities who were
                        responsible for their construction The city should be an exceedingly pretty
                        one . in future days when the avenues of trees have had sufficient time to
                        mature, and it cannot fail to strike the visitor with a sense of incongruity
                        when he suddenly comes across one of the principal offices of the Government
                        either propped up by slanting baulks of timber or at least bearing the very
                        evident signs of recent repair. Khartoum North with its extensive workshops
                        and its dockyard is now hardly to be recognized as the bleak sandy spot of
                        former days, and the completion of the bridge which crosses the Blue Nile at
                        this point will further serve to destroy the evidences of that time, still
                        fresh in the memories of most of us when a tardy Government left Gordon to
                        his doom on this opposite bank. But though every inde cement is given to the
                        native traders to make Khartoum North the centre of commerce, they still
                        cling to the old port of Omdurman as far as possible, the natural shipways
                        of the beach at the latter town being one of the principal causes which
                        prevent their ready acquie in the desire of the Government to centralize All
                        trade at Khartoum North, another reason being that on the occasions of a
                        baboon or sand storm, the former port offers far greater safety to the
                        shipping than does the latter. However all this will right itself when the
                        above mentioned bridge is finished, for those of the traders who continue to
                        exercise their preference for Omdarman will find that they are doing so at
                        the expense of reduced profits by reason of the increased facilities of
                        transport which will result in those who utilise the connection of Khartoum
                        with the new dockyard. Only one thing now stands in the way of ever
                        increasing prosperity in Sudan, and this lies in the underpopulation of the
                        rural districts. This evil will in the natural course of events take
                        generations to right itself, and it is on this point that the suggestions of
                        Sir Walter Mioville strike us as being distinctly useful. He condemns the
                        proposition of importing Negro blood from America, and no one who has
                        studied the conditions existing in Africa and America respectively can
                        gainsay the fact that such a proeedure would be fraught with very grave
                        dangers to the ultimate peace and wellbeing of the country, but he offers on
                        the other hand the suggestion of importing Mohamedan Indians from the more
                        congested and famine stricken portions of our Indian Empire. By this method
                        both India and the Sudan would benefit, the former by thus being relieved of
                        population which is in some districts too poor to support the latter by
                        being supplied with hands to place the more fertile of her depopulated
                        tracts under cultivation. Racial difficulties would not, as in the case of
                        American Negroes intrade themselves, or at least this danger would be very
                        greatly diminished, and as the question of the under population of the Sudan
                        is a most serions one for that country, we trust that this proposition to
                        remedy it will receive the early consideration of the authorities.</p>

                        <head>A Cyprus Treasure</head>
                        <p>Alexander Dingli v. Sivagian was a case arising from a notable find of
                            treasure in Cyprus some years ago. Me Paraschiva, for Dingli, told the
                            Tribunal that his client was for some time in partnership with the
                            Defendant, A personal friend, as a firm of dealers in antiques. Siva
                            gian had discovered and attempted to gain possession of the treasure in
                            question but the police interfered and only a small part was removed and
                            taken to Paris. Although entitled to one-fourth of the profits of any
                            deal made by the firm, Plaintiff had been kept in ignorance of this
                            affair, the Defendant alleging that Dingli had retired from the
                            partnership prior to the finding of the treasure. In reality, said
                            counsel, Plaintiff had never withdrawn; and although negotiations had
                            been entered into with a view to dissolution, it had not taken place.
                            Some doubt existed as to the resale in Paris but it was decided that Mr.
                            Pierpont Morgan had eventually purchased the "find' for £300,000
                            sterling. The Defendant's counsel maintained that the partnership had
                            been ended, as regards Dingli at a period anterior to the expedition to
                            Cyprug. Sivagian only had capital while Dingli and Tano (the other
                            partners) where to find the labour and receive half of the total profits
                            between them. Certain relatives of Dingli's had found the treasure but
                            Plaintiff himself did nothing except claim the money. A furions letter
                            received from him in June 1903 informed Sivagian that Dingli left him a
                            free hand and would do nothing to assist.</p>

                            his debts from October last till the opening of the present year. One
                            creditor (represented by Me. Ferrante) had received LE 20 in this way
                            and had renewed his bills; yet this game creditor now asks for the
                            debtors to be made bankrupt. Chaoraoui was merely unfortunate and not
                            fraudulent, as would appear from his balance sheet. At this point M.
                            Picciotto, a creditor, intervened in person to urge that the bankruptcy
                            could only be delayed for a week or so at the utmost; it was preferable
                            that the Court should declare it now and save further trouble. Me.
                            Nadda, for creditors of the defendant, said that the balance sheet
                            should have been deposited on December 21 instead of being retained
                            until Thursday last. In reserving judgment for a week, the Court
                            directed that all the four actions in this matter should be
                            consolidated.</p>

                            rooms, Dsed by the San Stefano Club, were occupied for the evening's
                            festivities. The rooms and salone, which are of large dimensions, were
                            richly carpeted, and with great banks of evergreens lit up with colored
                            electric lights and set out with divans and easy chairs gave a cosy and
                            homelike appearance, seldom attained in these large functions. . All the
                            élite of English society in Alexandria were present, and also the
                            Governor of Alexandria, H.E. Mustapha Pasha Ibadi, and his popular
                            secretary, Beneducci Bey. We also noticed, Rear Admiral Sir Massie and
                            Lady Blomfield, the Hon. Mrs. Hopkinson, Mr. and Mrs. Gould, Col. and

                            other leaders of society, but it is impossible to mention all the
                            guests, who numbered nearly two hundred. The ladies looked charming with
                            powdered hair. Officers in uniforms were present in large numbers, and
                            civilians were in Windsor uniform lending added colour and brightness to
                            a gay and animated scene. The only element lacking was the absence of
                            the Captain and Officers of H.M. 's "Diana" which unfortunately was not
                            in the harbour. From the first to last dance I was kept up with great
                            spirit. The floor was splendid, and the music of the reed band of the
                            Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, led by the band sergeant was all that
                            could be desired. A sumptuous supper was laid out in two large rooms,
                            and the menu of choice dishes reflected great credit on the chef of San
                            Stefano Hotel. A hot supper quickly served by plenty of deft waiters
                            proved the capacity of the hotel staff. The buffet was also excellent,
                            The arrangement of the rooms, decoration and lighting were all carried
                            out by Mr. Wenger, aided by his staff, and he is to be congratulated on
                            such a success in his first! year of management of the San Stefano
                            Hotel. He was indefatigable and omnipresent in seeing that everything
                            went off without the slightest hitch. Mrs. Lang Anderson and her
                            charming debutante, in whose honour the ball was given, may well be
                            pleased with the entire success of the evening, which was so heartily

                            whatsoever or agreement between the Party of the People and Lord Cromer
                            as is understood from your statement. If, as you say, the Party has been
                            favoured by the Lord who only regarded lit with respect, it would be the
                            same mapa favouring the Reform Party while you are not far as we think,
                            one of its members nor are you in accord with it. It must be, then, that
                            you have drawn your information on that subject from an untrustworthy
                            source which attempted to morally injure the Party. This is also one of
                            the photos of the war now waged against the Party war that is waged not
                            only publicly but also secretly, with weapons which we cannot deem
                            worthy or honourable. It is carried out by people who do not like to
                            hear a good word spoken on the side of the nation as opposed to her
                            authorities. If you are one of those who care that on his shoulder brace
                            up by themselves and the play should only rely on themselves in all seir
                            affairs (and we cannot believe you be otherwise ) then we would relieve
                            your anxiety by stating that the "Party of the People." will come on
                            unhurt by all these transient intrigues which will disappear the moment
                            they have brought their a horse the personal interests they hunt after
                            by means of them. As to your judgment about the "Party of the People ''
                            and the "Reform Party '', it is a thing that does not admit of
                            discussion being nothing more than a private opinion which we cannot but
                            respect. Yours truly, AHMED LUFTI EL SAYED. Director of "Al-Garidah."

                            Egypt " which I considered more or les interesting piece of fiction, I
                            hoped that we had heard Mr. Blunt's last word on Egypt; I regret to find
                            that it is not so, for not only is there a second edition published
                            within a few months, but with a malicious perspicacity, astonishing to
                            those who only knew Mr. Blant through his former works, he has published
                            a leaflet under the above heading, which at the attractive price of one
                            abilling might have an opportunity of circulation denied to his other
                            books, It is with some reluctance that I write to you on this subject,
                            nor should I have done so bnt for the insulting way in which Mr. Blunt
                            permits himself to speak of the British community in Alexandria to which
                            I have had the honour to belong for the last thirty years, though I have
                            not, I way it with some regret, that acquaintance with stocks and
                            shares, which to Mr. Blunt names no objectionable Did it ever occur to
                            Mr. Blunt that the pernicious effect of the fortaitons acquisition of
                            wealth, has seldom been better illustrated, than when it enabled him to
                            publish the books which have appeared in his name ; in which after
                            abusing many of his friends and his enemies, in terms of invective
                            rarely equalled in modern literature, he now comes before us as the man
                            who does not like strong language. Mr. Blont is fond of copying high
                            ideals and in this wise be reminds me of General Kleber, who when in
                            command of the French Army in Cairo, was reproached by his superiors in
                            Paris, with lack of discipline, for not duly carrying out their
                            instructions ; to which be replied “S'aime bien la discipline, mais
                            seulement en sous-ordre." In the few remarks I have to make on Mr.
                            Blant's latest production, I will endeavour at some restraint, to frame
                            them with such courtesy as may, under the circumstances, be due to the
                            fastidious mood of an old man. It is quite refreshing to be told by Mr.
                            Blunt that as Mr. (afterwards Sir John) Scott was judge of the Court of
                            Appeal he was unable to devote his whole time to journalism ; but the
                            principal object of the pamphlet to which I refer, is the base of Mr.
                            Moberly Bell, and in order to arrive at this genial result, Mr Blunt
                            publishes many telegrams address from Egypt to the "Times" by Mr. Bell
                            during the important events which occurred in this country between the
                            12th May and the 10th July 1882. I am pleased that Mr. Blant has given
                            me an opportunity of reading these telegrams again in a connected form ;
                            bat here my agreement .with him ends; he invites his readers to compare
                            the telegrams with his "Secret History"; I have carefully done so, and I
                            do not hesitate to say that as faithfully representing the state of this
                            country at that time,-Mr. Bell's telegrams are right, and Mr. Blunt's
                            "Secret History" is not. "As this is the pith of the whole question and
                            serves as the basis of Mr. Blunt's flimsy fabric, I feel it is due to
                            your readers, that I should not make this statement, without a few words
                            of explanation, as to the circumstances which enable me to make it
                            without much fear of contradiction. Unlike Mr. Blant, I have never for
                            more than thirty years past, felt called upon to leave Egypt in times of
                            danger or difficulty, or to depend for my information on an agent of
                            more or less doubtful antecedents. Any information I have, was collected
                            by myself, and during all the time referred to in the above mentioned
                            telegrams, I was in very frequent communication both with Arabi
                            personally, and with the principal members of his party, and during the
                            three weeks which preceded the bombardment of Alexandria, it was their
                            own escort which enabled me almost daily to visit the British Admiral in
                            the harbour, and themselves, at the Palace of Ras-el-Teen ; they had
                            good reason for offering me every facility I wanted for going about. I
                            had at that time many friends and acquaintances in Cairo and the
                            interior, both in government service and outside it. Most of these left
                            Egypt at this time, and I was naturally anxious to see them as they
                            passed through Alexandria. Without troubling you with further details, I
                            think this will suffice to show even Mr. Blunt, that I am qualified not
                            only to give an opinion on the above question, but that I had better
                            opportunities than most people of being well informed, for I did not at
                            that time, as Mr. Blunt puts it, live for removed from the higher life
                            of native Egypt" and had already known the country well for 12 years. I
                            remain etc., etc. J. E. CORNISH, M. Inst C.E. Alexandria, 24th January,
